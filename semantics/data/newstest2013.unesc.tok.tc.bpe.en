a Republi@@ can strategy to counter the re = election of Obama
Republi@@ can leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud .
however , the Brenn@@ an Centre considers this a my@@ th , stating that electoral fraud is r@@ arer in the United States than the number of people killed by ligh@@ tn@@ ing .
indeed , Republi@@ can lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade .
one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on vo@@ ter turn = out .
in this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
unlike in Canada , the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States .
it is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult .
this phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections , which saw 6@@ 75 new Republi@@ can representatives added in 26 States .
as a result , 180 bil@@ ls restri@@ cting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone .
the new election laws require voters to show a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship .
furthermore , these laws also reduce early voting periods , invali@@ date the right to register as a vo@@ ter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record .
before the 2006 elections , no US State required voters to show a photo ID card .
Indi@@ ana was the first State to impose such a requirement .
in 2008 , the Su@@ preme Court of the United States up@@ held the constitu@@ tionality of the Indi@@ ana law .
the Republi@@ can authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States .
over the past two years , they spon@@ sored bil@@ ls in 34 States to force voters to show a photo ID card .
it is important to note that , unlike Que@@ bec , American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card .
in fact , 11 % of American citizens , i.e. 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State .
in addition , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification .
and it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card .
the new restrictions dis@@ proportion@@ ately affect young people , minorities and people with low incomes .
in fact , 25 % of African Americans , 15 % of those ear@@ ning less than $ 35@@ ,000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card .
and that 's not all .
students , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution .
on the other hand , these same States allow fishing or hunting club members , who vote more Republi@@ can , to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote .
prior to 2004 , no State required proof of citizenship to vote .
Ari@@ zona was the first to introduce such a requirement .
since 2011 , a do@@ zen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens .
these measures are clearly intended to limit the H@@ isp@@ an@@ ic vote .
however , it appears that two out of three H@@ isp@@ an@@ ic voters favour the Democratic party .
what is more , in 2011 Republi@@ can legislat@@ ors spon@@ sored laws aboli@@ shing the registration of voters on election day in eight States .
in addition , they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register .
these restrictions are not without consequence .
for example , during the 2004 general election , vo@@ ter registration campaigns contributed to regi@@ stering around 10 million citizens .
however , the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17 % drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 .
in addition , Republi@@ can legislat@@ ors have en@@ acted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period .
for example , during the 2008 general election in Florida , 33 % of early voters were African = Americans , who accoun@@ ted however for only 13 % of voters in the State .
the same applied to H@@ isp@@ an@@ ics .
these represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who voted early .
on the other hand , 76 % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
of course , Democratic legislat@@ ors and their supporters vigor@@ ously opposed the adoption of laws restri@@ cting vo@@ ter registration .
several bil@@ ls were blocked by vet@@ oes of Democratic govern@@ ors .
the United States Att@@ or@@ ney General interven@@ ed to susp@@ end the most controversial laws .
they were able to partially limit the damage .
for example , only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card .
however , the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
democratic critics denoun@@ ce the parti@@ san character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influ@@ encing the 2012 results in key States .
a 2011 Brenn@@ an Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 17@@ 1 of the 2@@ 70 votes needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency .
it is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant imp@@ acts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections .
but one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turn = out .
in this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
pro@@ state cancer screening : take the test or not ?
indeed , the P@@ SA test sometimes shows er@@ ron@@ e@@ ous results with false negative or even false positive results , which involve unnecessary medical interventions .
enough to make already reluc@@ tant men hesitate to take screening tests .
take the test or not ?
we asked two specialists for their opinion .
in studies conducted in the United States , there was a lot of contamination between control groups , so it is difficult to interpre@@ t the data and make firm recommendations .
another study , this time a European one , concluded that there was a difference in mor@@ tality between patients who were scre@@ ened and those who were not .
this study also showed , with a follow = up after 12 years , that it is between 30 and 40 % more likely for met@@ ast@@ ases to occur in the absence of screening .
I therefore recommend the test from age 50 , or 40 if you have a direct relative who previously had pro@@ state cancer .
African = American men are also more at risk .
the key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected .
there are aggressive canc@@ ers and others that are in@@ dol@@ ent .
the patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer , by offering him the options available , not necessarily treating pro@@ state canc@@ ers that are not long = term life threatening , and op@@ ting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease .
today , many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening .
active monitoring will be suggested , and if the disease progres@@ ses , they will be offered treatment .
more and more , specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated .
therefore I recommend taking the test .
but the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it .
in collaboration with the Soci@@ é@@ té internationale d ' u@@ ro@@ log@@ ie [ Si@@ u ] , Mo@@ v@@ ember has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pro@@ s and cons of the P@@ SA test .

preventing the disease
unfortunately , there is no mi@@ racle recip@@ e for preventing cancer .
despite the progress in research , the adoption of healthy living hab@@ its remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it .
it is estimated that if everyone ate well and exerc@@ ised enough , 30 % of canc@@ ers could be prevented .
`` If no more people smo@@ ked , this rate would increase to at least 50 % , '' says Andr@@ é Beau@@ lieu , sp@@ ok@@ es@@ man for the Canadian Canc@@ er Society .
on the other hand , it is estimated that roughly 10 % of canc@@ ers are her@@ edi@@ tary .
some are also completely un@@ explained .
for the Canadian Canc@@ er Society , the fight against tobacco remains a priority , despite the decrease in the number of smo@@ kers .
cigare@@ ttes are linked to 85 % of lung cancer cases .
it is also a risk factor for a number of others .
this massi@@ vely damages people 's health .
`` E@@ ven today , there are 1.5 million smo@@ kers in Que@@ bec '' deplo@@ res sp@@ ok@@ es@@ person Andr@@ é Beau@@ lieu .
encouraging data : 10 years after giving up smoking , the risk of dying from cancer drop@@ s by half .
weight
over@@ weight and o@@ bes@@ ity are also con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the on@@ set of the disease , according to the SC@@ C .
they can increase the risks of cancer of the breast , col@@ on and rec@@ tum , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gu@@ s , pan@@ cre@@ as and u@@ ter@@ us .
`` Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against col@@ on cancer '' it is also said .
diet
the organisation also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat .
in large amounts , it increases the risks of developing col@@ o = rec@@ tal cancer .
likewise , so do cu@@ red meat products , and these should be avoided .
the conservation of meat by smoking , dr@@ ying or cur@@ ing can cause the formation of car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens .
`` Th@@ ey can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer '' it is explained .
vit@@ am@@ ins
in recent years , a number of scientists have studied the links between vit@@ amin supple@@ ments and cancer .
for the time being however their research is in@@ conclu@@ sive .
studies on vit@@ amin E are contradi@@ ctory , according to the SC@@ C .
while one study noted a decrease in the risk of pro@@ state cancer , another noted an increase .
also the effect of vit@@ amin D on cancer is not clear .
in addition , Mr Beau@@ lieu emphas@@ ises the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doctor .
`` Tak@@ ing a screening test does n't give you cancer . ''
the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son revealed
the announcement of the prob@@ able discovery of the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son created quite a sti@@ r last summer , and with good reason .
indeed , it is believed that this bo@@ son is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Univer@@ se , no less .
also it is the last partic@@ le whose existence is predic@@ ted by the Standard Model - our best or `` less worse '' explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed emp@@ i@@ ri@@ cally .
but for physi@@ ci@@ sts , it is still not completely sure that it really is the Hig@@ gs .
we know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authentic partic@@ le , and greatly re@@ sembles the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son predic@@ ted by the Standard Model .
in addition , new data un@@ v@@ ei@@ led this week at a large physi@@ cs Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this , but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure .
but let 's sup@@ pose that it really is the Hig@@ gs , since the chances of being mistak@@ en seem sli@@ m , and see what it is .
in our world , there is a fat@@ ally un@@ avoid@@ able law which states that two things can not meet at the same place at the same time .
there 's no way to break this rule - and do n't try too hard , you 'll go mad .
however , even though partic@@ le physi@@ cs is a very strange world , it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind : the Pau@@ li exclusion principle , which states that two partic@@ les can not occup@@ y the same space at the same time if they are in the same `` qu@@ ant@@ um state '' - this `` state '' consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics .
based on this , physi@@ ci@@ sts classi@@ fy partic@@ les into two categories .
in one corner we have good citizens called fer@@ mi@@ ons , who wis@@ ely o@@ bey the Pau@@ li principle .
while l@@ ur@@ king in the other are the bo@@ sons , a n@@ asty band of an@@ arch@@ ists who respect nothing - at all events , not this principle , which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time .
these bo@@ sons are then divided into two groups , according to the Ber@@ kel@@ ey Lab@@ s Par@@ ticle Ad@@ venture site ( absolutely extraordinary , by the way ) : mes@@ ons , which we will not discuss here , and `` force partic@@ les '' by which the great forces of nature are prop@@ ag@@ ated and to which the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son may be somehow related .
these bo@@ sons , it must be stressed here , are not all such exotic bugs as you might think .
in fact , if you can read this article , it is thanks to an extra@@ ordin@@ arily ban@@ al bo@@ son : the pho@@ ton , or the `` light partic@@ le '' which is the `` m@@ essenger '' of the electro@@ magnetic force .
when , in fact , a partic@@ le having an electric charge acceler@@ ates or changes direction , this `` distur@@ bs '' the electro@@ magnetic field in this specific place , rather like a p@@ eb@@ ble thrown in a p@@ ond .
this `` distur@@ b@@ ance '' produces an electro@@ magnetic wave ( of light , infra@@ red , ultra@@ viol@@ et etc . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a pho@@ ton - and thus one of the `` force carrier '' bo@@ sons .
more stable field
the same applies to the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son , with the difference that it is another field , the Hig@@ gs field , which must be `` distur@@ bed '' for the bo@@ son to appear .
now , this Hig@@ gs field is much , much more stable than the electro@@ magnetic field ; to exc@@ ite it , it is necessary to achieve very , very high energy levels , rather like a frozen p@@ ond which would need a very large rock to w@@ rin@@ kle the surface .
which is why a huge partic@@ le acceler@@ ator like the one at C@@ ER@@ N - the Lar@@ ge H@@ ad@@ ron Col@@ li@@ der is a ring with a 27@@ km circum@@ ference ! - is needed to achieve such energy levels .
the an@@ alog@@ y with the electro@@ magnetic field is again useful for expla@@ ining the relationship between the Hig@@ gs and mass .
in fact not all partic@@ les , or all materials , inter@@ act with the electro@@ magnetic field .
some , such as magne@@ ts , do so , but others do n't - a piece of paper , for example , will never stick to a fridge .
and likewise , not all partic@@ les inter@@ act with the Hig@@ gs field : those that do so have mass , while the others ( such as the pho@@ ton ) do not .
now , what is it that all this research `` can bring '' ? asks Ms P@@ lam@@ on@@ don .
for science , it serves to check the validity of the Standard Model ( SM ) , and also allows physi@@ cians to examine any discre@@ pan@@ cies between the observations and predic@@ tions of the SM .
a number of people , moreover , fer@@ v@@ ently hope that some will be found , because the sligh@@ test difference could open a door to a `` new physi@@ cs '' and plug certain holes in the Model .
this , it must be said , still has huge shortcomings , offering no explanation for gra@@ vity ( o@@ ops ! ) or dark matter , which forms approximately 80 % of the matter in the Univer@@ se ( re = o@@ ops ! ) .
but to date no such discre@@ pan@@ cies have been found at C@@ ER@@ N .
repercussions
the repercussions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct , but it would be wrong to assume that there wo n't be any .
remember : in the very early 6@@ 0s , the pione@@ ers of the laser at B@@ ell Labor@@ atories did not suspect the revolution that would be trig@@ gered by their work .
they had an in@@ kl@@ ing of the scientific applications , but nothing as to the rest .
in fact , the late Will@@ ard Bo@@ yle - a physi@@ c@@ ist who worked at B@@ ell Lab@@ s , where the laser was inv@@ ented in 1960 , and who himself developed the first continuous laser ( the first were pul@@ sed ) in 1962 - told us that initially the laser was rather seen as a `` la@@ b g@@ ad@@ get . ''
just imagine ...
and then , applications can also come from all the instru@@ mentation that sur@@ rounds research .
for example , the same Will@@ ard Bo@@ yle developed a small light sensor in 1969 , during his work in op@@ tics .
this sensor , although this was not at all the original intention , now serves as an `` eye '' to all digital cameras worldwide , and earned him the Nobel physi@@ cs prize in 2009 .
this does not of course mean that the activities of the L@@ HC will necessarily transform our lives , but it does mean that , actually , you never know ...
pal@@ li@@ ative care - The best way to die ... | Le De@@ voir
with its D@@ ying with D@@ ign@@ ity Commission , Que@@ bec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life .
the debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared .
however , in this vital area , much remains to be done .
le De@@ voir attempted to look more closely .
just a few weeks ago Mr L. lived alone in his Mont@@ é@@ ré@@ g@@ ie apartment .
the fest@@ ering pro@@ state cancer had allowed him a two = year resp@@ ite .
`` Th@@ ey gave me five years to live , I 've made it to seven , '' he says , with mixed emotions , lying in his bed at the Vic@@ tor = Gad@@ bo@@ is pal@@ li@@ ative care home in Bel@@ o@@ eil , where he arrived the previous day .
`` Bu@@ t it 's still a shock , you can never be prepared for it '' he adds .
the disease is doing its work : huge weakness which prevents him going to the toilet alone , and even eating alone .
sitting in front of an ap@@ peti@@ sing lunch , he con@@ s@@ ents to being helped to eat , re@@ signed .
coura@@ geous , he even manages to smile , talks to the stran@@ gers bu@@ st@@ ling around him , bringing him his medic@@ ation , offering him a bath .
the courage of ordinary death .
`` What I want most is to be cu@@ red of my di@@ ar@@ r@@ ho@@ ea , it 's hum@@ ili@@ ating '' he confi@@ ded .
a few hours later , the team found a cure for this illness .
`` Dur@@ ing our lives , we learn that a man p@@ is@@ ses standing up , '' says Pierre Bro@@ de@@ ur , psych@@ ologist at the Vic@@ tor = Gad@@ bo@@ is home .
reg@@ ressing to the stage of a child , for some people , is an unacceptable hum@@ ili@@ ation .
`` It depends on the person 's ability '' to accept the reg@@ ression , he says .
because , in the opinion of a number of people working in pal@@ li@@ ative care , great moments occur at the very heart of such reg@@ ression .
patients at the Vic@@ tor = Gad@@ bo@@ is pal@@ li@@ ative care home all suffer from cancer .
they have a maximum life expec@@ tan@@ cy of three months .
at this stage , the team of doctors and nur@@ ses surrounding them no longer provides so = called `` cu@@ rative '' care .
for Mrs A. , 89 years old , the worst fear is to die `` conscious and suff@@ oc@@ ating . ''
but the disease has made me discover my children .
`` I have fine children '' she adds .
`` I do n't wish for anything more in life '' she says , before accepting having a mask put on to help her brea@@ the .
she looks forward nevertheless , in the next few days , to a last visit by her son coming from Italy .
at Vic@@ tor = Gad@@ bo@@ is , a group of volunte@@ ers provides bo@@ di@@ ly care and help with feeding .
this is pal@@ li@@ ative care , given when there is nothing else that can be done .
to make death more comfortable .
in Que@@ bec , there are pal@@ li@@ ative care beds for 1@@ 1,@@ 700 inhabitants .
this is very few when we know that we will all die one day .
here , life continues under the best possible conditions , explains Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , one of the doctors at the home .
whether at a physical comfort , emotional or spiritual level .
a person who is dying will accept being helped to drink brand@@ y or P@@ ep@@ si , whatever is their ti@@ pp@@ le .
di@@ abe@@ tics no longer need to control their blood sugar .
and death is part of everyday life .
yesterday evening , a beer was served to Mr X , who died during the night .
this morning , it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the dec@@ e@@ ased .
`` We help rel@@ atives as much as patients '' says N@@ ath@@ ali@@ e Sav@@ ard , Director of Care .
at the Vic@@ tor = Gad@@ bo@@ is home , one day follows another but no two are alike .
along with a 93 = year = old man who is sav@@ ouring his last meeting with his family , sitting firmly we@@ dged in his pil@@ lows while to@@ asts are dr@@ unk in his honour , a 36 = year = young man is dying tra@@ gi@@ cally , surrounded by his parents , his wife and his two young children , after having tried everything to survive .
`` For six months , there have always been three to five beds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years old '' says a concerned Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel .
53 % of patients admitted to the Vic@@ tor = Gad@@ bo@@ is home come from their homes , 47 % from hospital .
lack of access to pal@@ li@@ ative care
it is said that 77 % of Canadi@@ ans simply have no access to pal@@ li@@ ative care , which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the terminal stage of life , be it at home , in hospital or in a care home .
and a number of organisations , such as the Vic@@ tor = Gad@@ bo@@ is home and the Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Society in Gre@@ ater Montreal , speciali@@ se more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients .
it is precisely this large gap in Que@@ bec health care which has made a number of pal@@ li@@ ative care physi@@ cians fear the adoption of a law on eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia and assisted suici@@ de .
since October , a manifest@@ o , signed by pal@@ li@@ ative care lum@@ in@@ aries including Dr Bal@@ four Mount and Dr Bern@@ ard La@@ poin@@ te , has been circul@@ ating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative .
according to Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , the Que@@ bec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality pal@@ li@@ ative care before it is accepted to proceed to eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia .
recently , she says , I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency , in great pain , without anything being done to ease her suffering .
I 'm afraid that patients ask to die because they do n't receive adequate care .
and at the same time , some on@@ c@@ ologists work rel@@ ent@@ lessly on their patients until the last day , despite the worst progno@@ ses .
H@@ é@@ l@@ è@@ ne Richard 's survival hopes were already minimal when she ended her gru@@ elling chem@@ otherap@@ y .
when I announced to my on@@ c@@ ologist that I was st@@ opping the treatment , she told me she regre@@ tted that I had given up fighting , she said .
however , she had told me I was finished !
no all = powerful care
Dr Mar@@ tel believes that 90 % of patients asking to die thank care = gi@@ vers for not having acc@@ eded to their request after they have been relie@@ ved of their pain by a pal@@ li@@ ative care team .
but it must be said that pal@@ li@@ ative care is not absolutely all = powerful in the treatment of pain .
according to El@@ sie Mon@@ ere@@ au , Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Director with the Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Society in Gre@@ ater Montreal , patients are resistant to treatment against pain in 8 % of cases .
at the very end of life , physi@@ cians then often resort to pal@@ li@@ ative se@@ dation , which is equivalent to putting the patient to sleep until the time of death , either spor@@ adi@@ cally or permanently .
we can no longer pre@@ tend not to understand this part of their suffering .
increasingly , an un@@ relie@@ ved patient will have the option of having such pal@@ li@@ ative se@@ dation .
patients who are not relie@@ ved always say the same thing : `` I want to die . ''
but this does not necessarily mean `` I want you to eu@@ than@@ ise me , '' it means `` I want to be relie@@ ved . ''
this report was made possible thanks to a journ@@ alism award from the Canada health research in@@ stitutes .
widespread real estate sc@@ and@@ als in Que@@ bec
day after day highway officials , building contrac@@ tors , political party fund = ra@@ is@@ ers and Italian ma@@ fia specialists tell what they know of a form@@ id@@ able `` system , '' combining the building industry , government officials , politicians , trade uni@@ on@@ ists and organised crime .
an `` industry '' which has cost Que@@ bec taxpayers de@@ arly , especially in the 1990s and 200@@ 0s .
`` It is cur@@ ious how the system is cru@@ mb@@ ling since we took dra@@ stic measures '' says Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au ir@@ on@@ ically , a Que@@ bec politi@@ cian and former Montreal Chief of Police .
it was through him that the scandal broke in 2011 , in an in = depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in Que@@ bec , to which the liberal Prime Minister at the time , Jean Cha@@ rest , had con@@ s@@ ented only reluc@@ t@@ antly .
the `` Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au report '' established a direct link between industry , under = the = table financing of parties and bri@@ ber@@ y of officials .
`` Sin@@ ce the inquiry opened in 2010 , he says , the Ministry of Transport alone re@@ porte@@ dly saved a billion dollars on contracts , '' with certain people cur@@ bing their inst@@ inc@@ ts to get a share !
the Char@@ bon@@ ne@@ au Commission `` has already brought down two may@@ ors '' he adds , hoping that it will succeed in `` reve@@ aling the schemes behind the individuals . ''
a permanent anti = corruption unit , created in 2011
the Per@@ man@@ ent Anti = Cor@@ ruption Unit , created in 2011 , is also coupled with its army of government an@@ al@@ yst@@ s , investig@@ ators , and audi@@ tors .
plus the `` Mar@@ teau squ@@ ad '' poli@@ c@@ emen who , since 2009 , have apparently led the Montreal `` se@@ wer car@@ tel '' to soft pe@@ dal on the inflation of contracts ...
in recent weeks , it has conducted a series of searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians , such as Frank Z@@ amp@@ ino and Richard Mar@@ co@@ tte , Mayor of a sub@@ urban town .
next on the list is apparently Gil@@ les V@@ ail@@ lan@@ court , who has just re@@ signed from his post as Mayor of Lav@@ al , third largest city in Que@@ bec .
he is susp@@ ected of po@@ ck@@ eting repeated bri@@ bes in exchange for public contracts .
others formally accused are Montreal highway engineers and Italian entrepreneurs , including Tony Ac@@ cur@@ so and Lin@@ o z@@ am@@ bit@@ o .
the latter caused a sen@@ sation by expla@@ ining the mechan@@ ics of the public contracts `` system '' to the commission .
he himself paid 3 % of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermedi@@ ary linked to the ma@@ fia who in turn paid the money to Union Mon@@ tr@@ é@@ al , Mayor G@@ ér@@ ald Tre@@ mb@@ lay 's party .
Mr z@@ am@@ bit@@ o has handed money out freely in the 200@@ 0s , giving over 8@@ 8@@ ,000 Canadian dollars ( roughly 68@@ ,000 euros ) to provin@@ cial parties , especially the Liberals then in power .
he also admitted having organised an illegal fund@@ ra@@ iser for former Liberal Dep@@ uty = Prime Minister , N@@ ath@@ ali@@ e Nor@@ man@@ de@@ au .
se@@ wer contracts with infl@@ ated costs
in Montreal , the corruption `` system '' ran smoothly .
Gil@@ les Sur@@ pren@@ ant , former public works engine@@ er , described it in detail in front of the commission : in ten years , he received from construction companies gifts , inv@@ it@@ ations to trips , golf tournaments , restaurants , ho@@ ckey matches and bri@@ bes tot@@ alling 7@@ 36@@ ,000 dollars , in exchange for se@@ wer contracts of which he infl@@ ated the costs .
other highway officials admitted having their pal@@ ms gre@@ ased by infl@@ ating invo@@ ices by 30 to 40 % , and by false add = ons .
then an organis@@ er of the Mayor 's party , Martin Dum@@ ont , accused Mr Tre@@ mb@@ lay of having deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his co@@ ff@@ ers with dirty money .
following these re@@ vel@@ ations , Mr Tre@@ mb@@ lay re@@ signed in early November , pl@@ ung@@ ing Montreal into a major crisis .
Ch@@ ant@@ al Rou@@ le@@ au was one of the first women in Montreal to raise the alarm .
Mayor of the bor@@ ough of Ri@@ vi@@ ère = des = Pra@@ i@@ ries , to the East of the island , she prote@@ sted in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and res@@ old for ... 1.@@ 6 million to developers , at the height of the real estate boom .
70 % dirty money in election campaigns
on the investigation which will eventually be implemented , she says she `` is following a thread in order to find out how the system - in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ated by ants - works , to put a stop to the gan@@ gr@@ ene and catch the cul@@ pr@@ its . ''
the process , she says , is `` painful but positive . ''
the wo@@ und is being cleaned , but Montreal would need its own investig@@ ative unit with ongoing monitoring , to avoid the return of these question@@ able practices .
how to clean house .
properly .
Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au notes for his part that `` officials st@@ ole hundreds of millions of dollars , '' but he is especially concerned about the role of `` elected people aware of the scheme , '' when they were not up to their ne@@ cks in the sc@@ am !
estim@@ ating the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Que@@ bec at 70 % , he says dr@@ y@@ ly : `` I was told that it was only a p@@ ale reflection of reality . ''
the Que@@ bec government proposes to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars , but this will not change the situation , he says : `` Un@@ til election expenses are strictly limited , there will be dirty money in politics . ''
he advocates a complete over@@ hau@@ l of the system for granting public contracts and party funding : `` We ca n't go any lower ; getting to the bottom of things , with courage , will help to re@@ build the house on more solid foundations , with more controls and laws . ''
although this story tar@@ nis@@ hes the international image of Que@@ bec and Montreal , Mr Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au invites anyone lau@@ gh@@ ing to look in their own back@@ yard ...
`` PS@@ G is not FC Barcelona ! ''
this season , you have taken on a new stat@@ ure with PS@@ G .
how do you explain this progres@@ sion ?
it can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PS@@ G .
some great players have arrived .
every day I 'm making progress alongside them .
the technical staff has also brought me a lot .
day by day , all these things help me raise my level of play .
and , in a match , it 's easier .
everything moves very fast in football .
but I do n't get worked up .
from my de@@ but at the C@@ la@@ i@@ re@@ fon@@ taine IN@@ F pre = training centre to my transfer to Saint = E@@ ti@@ enne , I 've always moved step by step .
so you benefit from the competition brought in by Carlo An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti ...
this summer 's recru@@ its are used to playing matches at a high level .
they also know that every training session is crucial .
which is what makes a player like me want to face up and give my best .
on the other hand , Carlo An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti gives me a lot as regards my position .
he 's supported by de@@ pu@@ ties like Clau@@ de Mak@@ el@@ ele , who played in the same position as me .
is An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti the man for the job ?
definitely .
An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti inspi@@ res respect among all the experts .
today he has no equal in Lig@@ ue 1 , and he 's one of the best co@@ aches in Europe .
he has m@@ asses of experience and has won many titles with top clubs .
he 's worked with great players .
I think he will bring more titles to Paris .
in January , I had an encouraging discussion with him .
I was just coming back from a series of in@@ jur@@ ies .
the confidence he gives me also explains my performance .
what importance do you attach to the first part of the season for PS@@ G ?
in Lig@@ ue 1 , Lyon over@@ took us at the top .
but we ' re waiting on the sid@@ el@@ ines .
one of our main goals is the Champ@@ ions League : we qualified for the last 16 in the right way .
what is the club 's goal in this competition ?
we 'll try to go as far as possible .
from now on , anything can happen .
but we 'll have something to say against some very good European teams .
first of all , we want to finish top in our pool , ahead of Porto , to have home advantage in the last 16 match .
can PS@@ G become a top European club in the short term ?
it already has the budget ...
to become a top European club , Paris needs to win titles and keep it up over time .
today , this is n't the case .
financially , PS@@ G has the means to make it happen .
in Lig@@ ue 1 , would not winning the title , like last season , be a big failure ?
definitely , it would be a major disappointment .
this year , we ' re really committed to winning the champ@@ ionship .
we were n't far away last season .
in May , there was great disappointment because we were good enough to finish first .
it was a terri@@ fic season .
we finished with 79 points .
normally , 79 points is good enough to be top ...
but another team , Mont@@ p@@ elli@@ er , had an even more fantastic season .
I think this is the year .
even if big teams like Mar@@ sei@@ lle , Lyon and Bor@@ deaux are competing for the title , I think we have the weapons to win .
do you think the media expect too much of PS@@ G ?
it 's normal for them to expect a lot from us given what 's been invested and the players we have .
we totally accept it .
after we won 4 = 0 at home against Tro@@ yes and they still found things to blame us for , that 's definitely a bit fru@@ str@@ ating .
you wonder what more people expect .
you ' re never going to win 4 = 0 every weekend .
we ' re not FC Barcelona !
we ' re trying to implement a game project .
it takes time to build a team .
the Champ@@ ions League proved we could hold our own .
look at Manchester City who , for two seasons , have failed to quali@@ fy for the last 16 , despite also having spent huge amounts !
based on the amounts invested , you should be 15 points ahead at the winter break !
that would be to ignore our opponents and the French Championship .
Lyon and Mar@@ sei@@ lle , who were no good last season , were `` boo@@ sted '' by the new PS@@ G .
this shows that Lig@@ ue 1 is exciting .
I hope that in May we will be able to smile in saying that , despite all the difficulties , we finally did it .
PS@@ G seem totally dependent on the explo@@ its of Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c .
so much so that people say there is a `` Z@@ lat@@ an dependence . ''
this means I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c is very successful and scores a lot of goals .
that 's why he came , and he 's pro@@ ving he 's the star of Lig@@ ue 1 .
he 's demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player , a world star .
within the group , we respect the man and the player .
and also he respects the men he has around him .
what he has done is truly exceptional .
it pus@@ hes others to raise their level of play .
T@@ hi@@ ago Sil@@ va , who is one of the best defen@@ ders in the world , also helps everyone else progress .
how did you get on in Euro 2012 with the France team ?
a disappointment .
I really wanted to play in this Euro .
unfortunately , my injury prevented me from getting any game time .
I saw some things there and came out stronger .
today , I 'm playing well in selection matches .
which is what I 've been hoping for since my b@@ ap@@ tism with the Blu@@ es .
I 've learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now owe it to myself to have exempl@@ ary behaviour .
what do think about Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ champ@@ s 's first few months in charge of the Blu@@ es ?
he has the results he wanted .
we ' re well placed in the World quali@@ fying group .
the coach is tough , close to the players , and inspi@@ res them to win .
like Lau@@ rent Blan@@ c was .
but I do n't want to make any compar@@ isons .
Blan@@ c had achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro .
I hope Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ champ@@ s will take the Blu@@ es to Brazil .
did the good draw ( 1 = 1 ) s@@ nat@@ ched in Spain , on 16 October , represent a founding match ?
that match gave us confidence .
everybody fought for everybody .
before that shock in Spain , I 'd never experienced such a match in my career .
with Bit@@ coin , pay and sell without banks
the opposite of current monetary exchanges , based on central banks , identified transactions and processing fees among the parties involved .
in addition , as often in these technologies , a political vision is pal@@ p@@ able : the belief that the current monetary system , made up of banking monopoli@@ es , leads to financial crises .
in fact , Bit@@ coin , inv@@ ented by Sat@@ o@@ sh@@ i N@@ ak@@ am@@ o@@ to ( a p@@ seu@@ don@@ ym ) , is both a virtual currency ( but con@@ verti@@ ble into dollars , euros ) and a secure exchange protocol like Bit@@ Tor@@ rent , which allows pe@@ er = to = pe@@ er file exchange .
around 200@@ ,000 transactions have already been recorded via 15@@ ,000 computers on the network .
close to a thousand web sites accept bit@@ coins as donations or means of payment .
the bit@@ coin exchange rate , after reaching a peak of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) in June 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months later , returning today to around a do@@ zen dollars ( rates are listed on the bit@@ co@@ in@@ char@@ ts@@ .com site ) .
nothing very impressive , compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products .
however , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October .
it describes bit@@ coin as `` the most successful virtual currency , '' `` in competition with the dollar or the euro '' and `` similar to conventional currencies . ''
Bit@@ coin diff@@ ers from other types of virtual currency such as ' credits ' , used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy ( and sometimes exchange in return ) .
the social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system .
but , on each occasion , a central authority controls and hand@@ les the exchanges .
with Bit@@ coin , all no@@ des in the network are both cu@@ sto@@ di@@ ans of the book of accounts , audi@@ tors , currency issu@@ ers , and bu@@ yers and s@@ ellers .
how does the network operate ?
each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an e = mail .
except that a user can choose a different address for each payment , thereby ensuring anony@@ m@@ ity .
a set of information associated with this transaction is signed electron@@ ically by a dual = key encryption system .
so the network can verify the authentic@@ ity of the transaction .
using the contents of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the ex@@ changed bit@@ coins exist in the public book of accounts , broadcast across the entire network .
the key step is entering the new transaction in the book .
it passes through the resolution of a mathemati@@ cal challenge issued to the computers , and the winner , a kind of interim central ban@@ ker , will have the privilege of adding this extra line .
this is a file h@@ ash@@ ing phase , i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital im@@ print .
computers `` take '' the new transaction and add a number to it , then `` h@@ ash '' it all up .
the goal being to find the number that gives a special im@@ print ( lots of zer@@ os at the beginning ) .
once this number has been found , the other no@@ des can easily check that it is the right one .
the transaction is then inde@@ struc@@ ti@@ bly linked to the chain of all the other transactions ; any modification would alter the im@@ print .
if a user wanted to def@@ rau@@ d by paying twice with the same money very quickly ( less than ten minutes ) , only one of the two transactions would be vali@@ dated by the network - the other would remain an or@@ ph@@ an because the two have different im@@ prints .
the computer that resol@@ ves the challenge wins 50 bit@@ coins .
to avoid inflation , this award is regularly divided by two , probably by the end of 2012 .
the number of bit@@ coins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million , but they are di@@ visible down to the hundred milli@@ on@@ th , which leaves some margin ...
the difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in comp@@ uting power .
the life of the network has had its ups and down@@ s .
websites providing services for Bit@@ coin have been attacked and bit@@ coins in deposits stol@@ en .
`` The lo@@ op@@ hole used is not the protocol itself '' says Pierre No@@ iz@@ at re@@ assur@@ ingly , who has just launched Pay@@ mium , a real currency payment company that uses the Bit@@ coin network .
the ECB also highlights the possibilities of money la@@ undering using this anonymous service .
but cash also has this weakness .
major players like Wiki@@ pedia refuse donations of this nature .
others , such as the WordPress blog platform , accept them .
recently , Ad@@ i Sh@@ am@@ ir and Dor@@ it R@@ on , from the Wei@@ z@@ mann Institute in Israel , analy@@ sed the accounting books and showed that almost 80 % of bit@@ coins do not circul@@ ate .
in November , `` huge sell = off@@ s '' were launched .
`` Thir@@ ty thousand dollars were ex@@ changed '' welcomes J@@ on Hol@@ m@@ qu@@ ist , who works for Co@@ in@@ ab@@ ul , which conver@@ ts bit@@ coins to gold .
Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , also author of an educational book on this currency , has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network .
his system , Pay@@ t@@ uni@@ a , is equivalent to a credit card ( in real money ) or a cont@@ ac@@ tless payment by mobile , but it uses Bit@@ coin to vali@@ date transactions , which are thus cheaper .
also the user manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous .
the system is easy to implement by merchan@@ ts , who do not need to install new terminals or software .
they just need to provide an address that a phone can `` photogra@@ ph and recognise '' says Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , who confirms he has thousands of users .
there is a general movement to re@@ app@@ raise hierarch@@ ical systems for more horizontal systems .
`` It will take time for Bit@@ coin to become firmly established , but 2013 could be a turning point , '' he predic@@ ts .
the ECB , in its report , says it will re@@ assess the various risks , currently regarded as high , in the event of the currency 's success .
we got out of Afghanistan .
what now ?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan ( Kap@@ is@@ a and Su@@ rob@@ i ) .
NATO and the Americans are due to follow in late 2014 .
it is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future , without expecting us to do everything .
it is mainly Afghan pe@@ as@@ ants that we have punished by regarding them as terrorists .
and ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , plus the wo@@ und@@ ed , the ma@@ im@@ ed .
the Taliban is composed of foreign extre@@ mi@@ sts , former leaders in refu@@ ge in Pakistan , but often pe@@ as@@ ants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces , like in the time of the Sovi@@ ets .
they want to defend their traditions , both ancient and arch@@ ai@@ c , even though they have been joined by Ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts , Pakist@@ an@@ is , Ara@@ bs , U@@ z@@ be@@ ks , Ta@@ ji@@ ks .
toler@@ ated , sometimes assisted , by local insur@@ g@@ ents , the latter will no longer be so when West@@ ern@@ ers become more scar@@ ce .
the departure of French troops from the Ni@@ j@@ ra@@ b base , which I observed from the top of hills of al@@ mond trees plan@@ ted with French funding , was carried out in an or@@ derly fashion .
con@@ vo@@ ys of trucks and arm@@ oured vehicles reached Kab@@ ul without being attacked , over@@ flo@@ wn by helicop@@ ters .
there will be no wave of the Taliban in Kab@@ ul by the end of 2014 .
circumstances have changed since their ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble advance between 1994 and 1996 .
at that time Kab@@ ul was empty , the country being tor@@ n apart by the stru@@ gg@@ les between different fac@@ tions .
their ta@@ ke@@ over of the country had been perceived then as a sort of liber@@ ation , a return to safety .
Afghan@@ is paid the price of the obs@@ cur@@ anti@@ sm of these pe@@ as@@ ants by the organisation of Al = Q@@ ae@@ da , but their situation has not improved today .
former Mu@@ ja@@ hi@@ din , the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are al@@ lied in the desire to keep women in an inf@@ eri@@ or position .
the main anti = Soviet war leaders returned to power in 2001 .
they became profit@@ e@@ ers , sei@@ zing government land to res@@ ell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan , benef@@ iting from huge American outs@@ ourcing contracts .
they have become dis@@ credited ; what is more , most of them did not fight themselves .
the people , as I heard in the countryside , want a Government that is not made up of th@@ ie@@ ves .
many young people want to leave , as those who were able to benefit from American lar@@ ges@@ se will leave : the flight of capital is considerable .
the young people are tired of war and its ide@@ ologies .
they have rub@@ bed shoul@@ ders with the modern world during their ex@@ ile in Iran or Pakistan , and appreciated the benefits .
roughly 65 % of the population is less than 25 ; Kab@@ ul now has 5 million people , a fifth of the total population .
in towns and cities , the state schools are full , with girls and boys alike .
it will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the obs@@ cur@@ anti@@ sm of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders .
all of them , including the armed opponents , are partial to mobile phones ; television , with its Turkish so@@ ap oper@@ as that show a modern world , is followed everywhere .
the army is now present .
will the authorities who command it be considered legitimate ?
former comm@@ anders of the anti = Soviet struggle are already thinking about rest@@ oring provin@@ cial m@@ ili@@ ti@@ as , which will escape the central power .
Afghanistan , land of mountains , with strong local identi@@ ties , should be able to benefit from a certain decentrali@@ sation , in the image of the Western nations , but the United States wanted to turn it into a centrali@@ sed State , with strong presidential power , aboli@@ shing the post of Prime Minister , which had existed since the 1964 Constitution .
President Kar@@ z@@ ai does not want any foreign controls , particularly on the occasion of the elections in April 2014 .
but , since the 50@@ s and already well before , his country has been dependent on foreign aid .
no industries have been re = established , no dams are in good condition , no major ir@@ ri@@ gation systems have been rep@@ aired .
everything is imported ; nothing is produced , apart from fruit and vegetables .
the Pri@@ ority is left to private initiative .
in a country ru@@ ined by thirty years of war , government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary .
the rum@@ our was spread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth .
this only added to the feeling that the West@@ ern@@ ers were only there to sei@@ ze it .
with no energy to process the iron ore or copper on site , or means of transport to export it across the mountains , there is no mining .
the Chinese have already almost left the M@@ es A@@ yn@@ ak copper mine , leaving international archae@@ ologists ( funded by the World Bank ) to search the huge Buddh@@ ist site and remain the largest employers in the province .
one day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan , on which imports and exports largely depend , to restore normal relations .
the departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November .
the new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls ' high school , boys ' high school , French Department at the University , French Institute , cooperation in the military , legal , medical and agricultural fields , support to the archae@@ ological Delegation .
since 2009 , to try to `` win hearts and minds '' and achieve the impossible task of re@@ conc@@ iling aid and offensive actions , a `` civil = military actions '' service from the Ministry of defence ( C@@ im@@ ic ) , closed in 2012 , has carried out , and continues to carry out successfully , through a small French NG@@ O , many community and agricultural rehabilitation projects in do@@ zens of mountain villages .
these projects , involving large numbers of local labour , have helped to contain the insur@@ gency : ir@@ ri@@ gation , w@@ ells , drinking water , re@@ fore@@ station , fruit trees , soil protection and increase in cultiv@@ able areas .
what will we leave as a sou@@ ven@@ ir , after two billion euros of military spending ?
a much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions , which are very hard in these valleys often located over 2@@ ,000 metres above sea level .
the E@@ mb@@ ass@@ y has received do@@ zens of written requests for small agricultural projects from local communities in Kap@@ is@@ a province .
to be in a position to free themselves from the u@@ pr@@ ising led by foreign groups , which is what farmers told me they want , a small amount of civil aid should be maintained in their favour , well controlled and directly affecting them .
a Constitution by force in Egypt
a new gam@@ ble for President Moh@@ amm@@ ed Mor@@ si .
while Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration , which temporarily grants him full powers , he has decided to go for broke .
taking everyone by surprise , he announced on Wednesday that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day .
just a week ago , the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work .
for two years Egypt has re@@ lied on a pro@@ visi@@ onal text , amended several times and this has weak@@ ened institutional stability and led to legal im@@ bro@@ gli@@ os .
this new initiative has only served to enhance the divide in the country .
according to his opponents , the President is per@@ sever@@ ing in his `` auto@@ cratic deli@@ ri@@ um , '' continuing to `` go back on his word '' and ' tra@@ mp@@ le the law . "
his supporters affir@@ m that this is the quick@@ est way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis , by spee@@ ding up the transition process .
a referendum is due to be held within the next two weeks .
a very short period , which forces the Bro@@ thers to abandon their plan to explain the text , article by article , to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
for the President , it is also a way to achieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute ra@@ ges throughout the country .
Moh@@ amm@@ ed Mor@@ si seems convinced that Egyp@@ ti@@ ans will vote fav@@ oura@@ bly , as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time .
particularly since a ha@@ sty vote sm@@ acks of an ultim@@ atum to the Egyptian people : `` Ei@@ ther you vote for my text , or I keep full powers , '' these powers sup@@ pose@@ dly exp@@ iring following adoption of the Constitution .
it was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constitu@@ ent Assembly , with a large Islam@@ ist majority , voted on the text yesterday .
most of the liber@@ als were missing .
in mid = November , shortly before the constitutional declaration , they had sl@@ amm@@ ed the door , feeling they had failed to asser@@ t their views .
representatives of human rights , religious minorities or civil society had done likewise .
in order to obtain a qu@@ or@@ um , 11 members , altern@@ ates , were h@@ as@@ ti@@ ly added yesterday morning .
some of them are very close to the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood .
not surprisingly , the articles were for the most part voted unanimously .
comm@@ ent@@ ators were also am@@ used that one of the only diver@@ sions of the day was expressed with regard to ... the hour of pra@@ yer , some Committee members feeling that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly clock was wrong .
the text , which was still being voted on yesterday evening , has 23@@ 4 articles .
the main focus of attention , article 2 , remains in the final analysis identical to that of the 1971 Constitution , stipul@@ ating that `` the principles of sh@@ aria are the main source of law . ''
the Sal@@ af@@ ist parties , for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim , were hoping to replace `` the principles '' by `` the rules , '' which would have allowed stricter application .
for the Islam@@ ists , the fact that this article was not amended is a guarantee of their good@@ will and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society .
`` Hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y '' respond the liber@@ als , who see only a communication coup .
because in their opinion Islam@@ isation of the Constitution is done through other articles .
they refer in particular to article 220 , which grants Al = Az@@ h@@ ar University an advisory role , with particular reference to veri@@ fying the con@@ formity of the laws with sh@@ aria .
according to Egypt specialist Sop@@ hie P@@ omm@@ ier , this is worrying because " the people called upon to advise are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy .
this suggests the beginn@@ ings of a the@@ o@@ cracy . "
the liber@@ als ' fears are also fu@@ elled by the fact that the next Rec@@ tor of the university will probably be much less moderate than the current one .
" for the time being , there is no concrete religious implic@@ ation .
with this Constitution , things remain under civil rule .
most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Islamic law schol@@ ars but ac@@ adem@@ ics , some trained in the French system " quali@@ fies Ale@@ xis Bl@@ ou@@ et , who is writing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition .
but he acknowled@@ ges that " there may be some ambigu@@ ity regarding article 220 , because the terms used bor@@ row from the religious voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary .
reference is made in particular to `` fi@@ q@@ h '' [ Islamic jur@@ isp@@ ru@@ dence , Editor 's note ] .
and the question could be asked in future to what extent civil judges are competent to pronoun@@ ce on it . "
beyond its religious aspect , the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic .
the Muslim Bro@@ thers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime .
another issue : the powers confer@@ red on the army .
in accordance with the wishes of the military , the Defence budget review will be not submitted to Parliament , but to a National Defence Council .
nor will trials of civilians will be banned in military tri@@ bun@@ als , as requested by associations for the defence of human rights .
who also voice their concerns about the text , which they consider repres@@ sive .
the off@@ ence of blas@@ ph@@ em@@ y is maintained and insul@@ ts are now prohibited , which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression , particularly for the press .
in addition , no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women , highlights H@@ EB@@ A Mor@@ a@@ ye@@ f , from Human Rights Watch .
in her opinion , the only positive point is the prohi@@ bition of torture in article 36 .
the word was not included in the previous Constitution .
while the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television , demonstrations are planned for this afternoon .
supporters of the Head of State will mar@@ ch on Saturday .
in Israel , hol@@ y places await Ukrainian tourists , the O@@ mp@@ hal@@ os and a sea of sal@@ ine water
the Holy Land combines the sp@@ l@@ end@@ our of bi@@ bli@@ cal tru@@ ths , modern comfort and pri@@ me@@ val nature .
A@@ IF [ Argum@@ ent@@ i i Fak@@ ti ] newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel .
let 's wor@@ ship the hol@@ y places
it is worth visiting the River Jordan where Jesus was b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed .
it is considered that all who enter this b@@ ap@@ tism `` bath '' are bl@@ essed by God .
Galile@@ e is the place where Jesus performed his magic : turned water into wine at a wedding , wal@@ ked on water , cal@@ med a storm , and filled the nets .
this is also where Jesus came before his dis@@ ciples and after the res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion .
but the biggest number of hol@@ y places is in Jerusalem .
belie@@ vers walk through the W@@ ay of Grie@@ f or Via Dol@@ or@@ o@@ sa .
it starts by the Ant@@ onia Fort@@ ress - Pra@@ et@@ orium - where the jud@@ gement took place , and brings us along the streets of the Old Town to the Church of the Holy Sep@@ ul@@ ch@@ re on Gol@@ go@@ tha - the place of the cru@@ ci@@ fi@@ xion , St@@ one of un@@ ction and the place of Jesus ' bur@@ ial .
this is also the location of the symbolic Christian O@@ mp@@ hal@@ os , which symboli@@ zes the sal@@ vation of mankind .
the Holy Cross Mon@@ astery in Jerusalem is er@@ ected at the site that , according to Christian legend , yiel@@ ded the tree used to make the cross for Jesus ' cru@@ ci@@ fi@@ xion .
Jerusalem has the most hol@@ y places for the Jews as well - the W@@ ailing Wall , which remained from a temple destroyed by the Rom@@ ans in 70 AD .
according to tradition , people of different fai@@ ths leave notes here with their wishes , which are then fulfilled .
travel along a vertical
ruins of the Mass@@ ada Fort@@ ress remain from a secret refu@@ ge from enemies , built by Her@@ od in 25 BC for his family .
they are located on cli@@ ffs in the mountains at an elev@@ ation of 450 m above sea level .
they can be reached on foot only by those who are into mountain climbing .
others are delivered to this historical mountain@@ top by a cab@@ le@@ way .
in the north of the country , at an elev@@ ation of 16@@ 00 = 20@@ 40 m , there is a famous ski resort called Her@@ mon , which fil@@ ls up with tourists in winter months .
a shuttle bus brings people to it from the foot of the mountain .
the total length of ski pist@@ es is 45 km .
according to an ancient legend , p@@ agan go@@ ds used to live on the mountain .
visit unique museums
this country has about 300 museums .
you wo n't be able to visit all of them on one trip
but at least the five most interesting ones are worth a visit .
among them - Museum of Israel , located close to Kn@@ es@@ set ( Parliament ) .
it has ancient Q@@ um@@ ran man@@ us@@ cri@@ pts and De@@ ad Sea sc@@ roll@@ s found in the cav@@ es of the Ju@@ de@@ an desert , along with about 500@@ ,000 archae@@ ological and an@@ th@@ rop@@ ological ar@@ te@@ facts .
the Museum of Art in Tel = Avi@@ v is also interesting .
its exhi@@ bits include a wide range of impres@@ sion@@ ists and expres@@ sion@@ ists like Mon@@ et , P@@ iss@@ ar@@ ro , Reno@@ ir , Sis@@ ley , Ce@@ z@@ anne , M@@ ati@@ sse , Mo@@ dig@@ li@@ ani , Cha@@ g@@ all , Pic@@ asso .
in Ak@@ ko , you can visit the bath museum Al = Bas@@ ha , which consists of several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bath atten@@ dants of the time .
in Ca@@ es@@ area , it is worth visiting the unique private R@@ all@@ i Museum , where you can enjoy the sculp@@ tures of Dal@@ i and Ro@@ din .
there are no tour guides or gift shops .
entry is free of charge , and contributions are strictly not allowed .
the fifth one is the Holo@@ cau@@ st Museum or Y@@ ad V@@ ash@@ em in Tel = Avi@@ v , which tells one of the most dramatic stories in history .
the most tragic section is the children 's mem@@ orial , built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas cham@@ bers .
you go in and find yourself in complete dar@@ k@@ ness .
stars are g@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing ,
and you listen to names of Jewish children and countries where they died .
Ukraine is mentioned there too .
wellness
there are three resort areas in Israel , located on the co@@ asts of the Mediterranean , Red , and De@@ ad Se@@ as .
each have swimming pools , aqu@@ a parks , dol@@ p@@ hin@@ aria and oc@@ e@@ an@@ aria .
it is not@@ able that one can swim in the Red Sea even in winter months , because the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air war@@ ms to 23 degrees .
the De@@ ad Sea is even war@@ mer , and people swim in it all year round .
incidentally , it is the most unusual sea in the world , located in the lowest point of the planet - 4@@ 17 m below sea level .
its az@@ ure water is sal@@ ine and easily keeps you af@@ lo@@ at , even if you do n't know how to swim .
the surrounding landscapes are sur@@ real in their beauty .
people come here to under@@ go a course of treatment using salt water - wra@@ ps and medicinal mu@@ ds , and to improve their health if they have der@@ mati@@ tis , aller@@ gi@@ es , as@@ th@@ mas , ec@@ z@@ em@@ as , ar@@ th@@ riti@@ s , bron@@ ch@@ iti@@ s , or di@@ abetes , or to return emotional balance .
touch the myst@@ eries of anti@@ qu@@ ity
they are preserved in the old section of Tel = Avi@@ v - in the town of J@@ aff@@ a on the Mediterranean Sea .
the famous sea route connecting Egypt , Syria , An@@ ato@@ lia , and Mes@@ o@@ pot@@ am@@ ia runs through it .
the city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legen@@ ds .
according to legen@@ ds , this is where No@@ ah built his ar@@ k and Per@@ se@@ us saved the beauty Andro@@ me@@ da , with whom he lived a long and happy life .
tourists really like to wan@@ der the narrow streets named after signs of the zo@@ di@@ ac .
they say , if you touch the walls on the street of your sign , fortun@@ e will come to you .
in J@@ aff@@ a , you can meet new@@ ly@@ we@@ ds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for photo sessions .
and in Ca@@ es@@ area - the city of King Her@@ od - you can walk around a Roman theatre , `` capture '' the Crus@@ ader fortress .
during the Roman period , Ca@@ es@@ area was the main city of Ju@@ de@@ a and the residence of Roman pre@@ f@@ ects , including Pon@@ ti@@ us Pil@@ ate .
the carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances .
a note for the tourist
when you go to Israel , do n't worry about your bad English knowledge : approximately 30 % of the country 's population speaks Russian .
for the trip , it is better to take dollars , not euros , because they are easily ex@@ changed for sh@@ ek@@ els ( currently 1 dollar = 3.@@ 8 sh@@ ek@@ els ) .
city transportation is mainly buses , but Jerusalem has a high = speed tram , and Hai@@ fa has the only subway line in the country , comp@@ rising six stops and connecting upper town with lower .
in essence , it is an underground cable railway .
a ticket for any type of city transportation costs 6 sh@@ ek@@ els , and you can ride for 1.5 hours with transfers .
according to the Jewish tradition , Sab@@ bath is celebrated in Israel .
between Friday evening and the sun@@ set on Saturday , markets , stores , and public transportation stop working .
the work week starts on Sunday morning .
many cafes , restaurants and hotels have only ko@@ sher food , with no por@@ k , seaf@@ ood , fish with no sc@@ ales , or dishes that combine milk with meat .
there is a wide selection of dishes from lam@@ b and beef , sou@@ ps and des@@ ser@@ ts co@@ oked using co@@ con@@ ut milk , traditional Jewish hum@@ mus pa@@ ste , various sau@@ ces , fal@@ af@@ el ( balls made of ground chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as ) , fruits and vegetables .
the streets of Israel do n't have hom@@ eless dogs .
but there are many well = fed c@@ ats , which walk around la@@ zi@@ ly .
in the evening , they can even be seen sleeping on roo@@ fs of par@@ ked cars .
these p@@ uss@@ y@@ c@@ ats like busy places and do not refuse tre@@ ats .
car rental , depending on car type , costs from 37 ( Hy@@ un@@ da@@ i Get@@ z ) to 18@@ 8 ( Au@@ di A@@ 6 , Vol@@ vo S@@ 80 ) dollars a day .
plus insurance of 15 dollars a day .
bike rental costs 15 sh@@ ek@@ els a day .
Museum entrance costs 30 sh@@ ek@@ els on average .
in numbers
in 2012 , over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel .
visitors and holi@@ day@@ makers arrive mostly from the USA , Russia , France , Germany , Italy , England , and Ukraine .
between January and October 2012 1@@ 18@@ ,@@ 800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Holy Land , which is 51 % more than a similar figure in 2010 , before the removal of the visa regime on February 9 , 2011 .
only the `` high and mi@@ ghty '' make it to Moscow : migrants save money for language
while de@@ pu@@ ties and human rights activists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory language testing , the country already has sc@@ am artists who sell fa@@ ke certificates .
every year , 13 million m@@ igrant workers come to Moscow , St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia .
mostly these are citizens of Central Asia : U@@ z@@ bekistan , Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan and Turk@@ men@@ istan .
their only goal is to earn money to support families back home .
a new law came into effect on December 1 , which obli@@ ges every m@@ igrant worker to pass a Russian language test .
for the moment , this law applies only to those who intend to work in services , housing and utility services , household services , and retail .
but with time - as promised by the Federal Migration Service - tests will become mandatory for all non = residents .
in addition to language , Russian history and basi@@ cs of the legal system will be tested .
language knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive and to extend the work permit .
an exception is in effect only for citizens of countries where Russian is a state language .
people who received education certificates and diplom@@ as before the fall of the US@@ SR in 1991 are also exemp@@ t under the law .
purpose , do@@ omed fate , and the protection of rights
seven testing points will be operating under the au@@ sp@@ ices of the P@@ ush@@ kin Institute of Russian Language , Pe@@ oples ' Friend@@ ship University of Russia , Moscow State University ( M@@ G@@ U ) , St. Petersburg State University ( SP@@ b@@ G@@ U ) , and other Russian education institutions .
migrants can take the tests in all cities ; more than 160 such centres have been opened .
the initiative to introduce the testing was supported by State Dum@@ a members and the Federal Migration Services .
but human rights activists , asked the question repeatedly in the press before the law came into force : what will it actually achieve ?
what will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and for the non = residents ?
first of all , according to representatives of the migration service , this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from labour sla@@ very .
many speak about protection of the rights of work migrants , explains the Head of the representative office of the Federal Migration Services of Russia , Vi@@ ktor Seb@@ ele@@ v .
rights protection should begin before their departure .
only the system of organized selection will enable us to solve 90 % of the problems of foreign workers .
migrants without profession , education , who do not know Russian , who do not have a medical certificate start to have problems .
if a m@@ igrant does not understand the language , says Seb@@ ele@@ v with certainty , he is do@@ omed to come across un@@ con@@ scienti@@ ous people , who , pre@@ ten@@ ding to help , will force upon him a `` ticket '' to terrible , cra@@ mp@@ ed bar@@ ra@@ cks where many others like him will suffer without food and documents , sla@@ ving away 12 = 14 hours a day .
we receive many complaints from our migrants .
`` Th@@ ey are promised one thing at home , but when they arrive , they are lied to , their pas@@ sports are taken , they are not paid what they were promised , '' confirms the Head of the Main M@@ igrant Labour Administration of the Migration Service of Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan To@@ li@@ b Sh@@ ari@@ po@@ v .
not be an@@ gr@@ y , bo@@ ss !
nonetheless , many citizens of Central Asian countries , who plan to go to work in Russia , admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they can barely write in their own language .
naturally , this is not so much their fault , but due to poverty : very few Tur@@ ks , U@@ z@@ be@@ ks , and Ta@@ ji@@ ks can afford even a basic education .
their families do n't even have food to feed their children , not to mention decent clothing , shoes , and supplies .
after reaching ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence , these kids go to work at the first opportunity .
it is hard , if language knowledge is bad , they admit .
`` You feel hum@@ ili@@ ated and inf@@ eri@@ or . ''
but human rights activists note one important point about the law on language .
testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status .
if they have no status , there will be no testing , nor any official work in the future .
in the meantime , most of the m@@ igrant workers continue to live in Russia illeg@@ ally .
`` Wel@@ come , or No Un@@ authorized En@@ try ''
many of the foreigners asser@@ t that receiving official status in our country is not that easy .
the reason lies in bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and the already mentioned language difficulties .
in addition , leg@@ alization costs money : from 12@@ ,000 to 16@@ ,000 rub@@ les .
whereas a fa@@ ke registration is done quickly and costs only one and a half thousand .
officers of the Russian Police know that we mainly have fa@@ ke papers , without registration , hence the ex@@ tor@@ tion .
`` Th@@ ey ask for a hundred or two for cigare@@ ttes , tea , '' Um@@ ed Kh@@ ush@@ k@@ ad@@ am@@ ov , a citizen of Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan , shared with journalists .
`` Rol@@ l up , do n't be cheap , get your art@@ work ''
on the first day of the law 's entry into effect it turned out that not only m@@ igrant registration documents can be fa@@ ke .
a few for@@ ged certificates about passing language tests have been sei@@ zed by Federal Migration Services officers already .
for@@ ged documents are printed on a standard colour printer .
naturally , they were not free for their owners : each of the migrants , who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand rub@@ les for them .
it is two and a half times more than the process of official testing , which costs three thousand .
government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption , so that the certificates could not just be bought .
for the moment , the authorities can promise m@@ igrant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course .
in addition , those who come without Russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people .
the Ministry of the Inter@@ ior does not put arms from the illegal market back into circulation
the share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low
the Russian Ministry of the Inter@@ ior is proposing to tou@@ gh@@ en up the law for owners of civil weapons .
this is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents : click shots at we@@ d@@ dings , where there were no cas@@ u@@ alties , and the mass@@ ac@@ re st@@ aged by Moscow lawyer D@@ mit@@ ry V@@ ino@@ gra@@ do@@ v , resulting in CL@@ IC@@ K the death of seven people .
poli@@ c@@ emen want to prohi@@ bit the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the legal age of weapons licensing from 18 to 21 .
the idea was supported by the head of the Dum@@ a Committee on Safety and Anti = Cor@@ ruption , I@@ rin@@ a Y@@ aro@@ va@@ ya , who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State Dum@@ a in the near future .
not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by `` tigh@@ tening the scre@@ ws . ''
an open letter appeared online , whose authors - representatives of different social ri@@ f@@ le organizations - demand to abandon the `` sen@@ sel@@ ess tou@@ gh@@ ening . ''
the percentage of crime involving registered weapons is minimal , said criminal lawyer V@@ asi@@ ly Les@@ ni@@ kov to BBC Russia .
according to the Ministry of the Inter@@ ior 's statistics , 142 crimes using fire@@ arms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012 , whereas 1,@@ 16@@ 8@@ ,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period .
authors of the open letter are certain that the tou@@ gh@@ ening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the `` black '' market .
according to them , one can find any weapon at a low price right now .
nonetheless , the Ministry of the Inter@@ ior asser@@ ts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control .
suppliers : from plants to officers
the `` black '' market of weapons is re@@ plen@@ ished through several channels .
there are five such channels , explains reti@@ red colon@@ el Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets , who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Sta@@ ff for 10 years .
scre@@ ens@@ hot of the site that accepts orders for weapons .
first : `` army or military lo@@ ot , '' i.e. weapons that were stol@@ en during the fighting in the Caucasus .
`` We@@ ap@@ ons were stol@@ en by Russian officers and by the Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans , '' says Bar@@ an@@ ets .
next are `` black weapons , '' stol@@ en by criminals from representatives of defence agencies .
Bar@@ an@@ ets explains that this covers weapons taken from police ware@@ houses and those stol@@ en directly from law enforcement agencies ' employees .
illegal arms are taken to be sold from military ware@@ houses .
explo@@ sions have often been heard at military ware@@ houses .
`` There are proven the@@ ories that some of the fires were inten@@ tional , in order to cover the shortage , '' says the former military man .
manufacturers of weapons make their contribution , according to Bar@@ an@@ ets .
`` There are so many private weapons factories now , which do not end@@ ure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market , including in Moscow , '' says the expert .
another source of the `` black '' market is trafficking .
an especially high number of g@@ uns and machine g@@ uns come from poor countries like Ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z@@ stan .
`` There 's production there , sometimes hand@@ made ; and a ma@@ fia has formed , which has organized a stream , '' explains the former military man .
where do the weapons come from ?
experts counted the approxim@@ ate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the `` black '' market .
a report about this was prepared by the Centre of Problems Analy@@ sis and Public Management Plan@@ ning in 2011 .
experts analy@@ sed the reports of the Department of the Inter@@ ior and Ros@@ stat , crimin@@ ology literature and open data from port@@ als on weapons .
the overwhelming majority of illegal weapons , according to the researchers , comes from the military and security forces .
half of all arms on the black market are there `` because of officials , whose work is connected with weapons , '' states the report .
according to researchers ' data , 17 % of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas , 14 % is the@@ ft during production , 5 % is `` black archae@@ ology . ''
a sales consul@@ tant of one of the weapons stores , who wished to remain anonymous , asser@@ ts that the weapons found by `` black '' dig@@ gers are not being bought any more , because they ' re too old .
according to him , dealers go to the military ware@@ house for a new bat@@ ch of goods .
one piece , for example a T@@ T gun can be bought from a warrant officer .
it is issued to him , and given through the f@@ ence .
`` He takes it to the city and s@@ ells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines , '' he says .
`` The truth is that police are aware of everything , that is why periodi@@ cally , when the crime detection rate is low , it conduc@@ ts test purchases from illegal weapons merchan@@ ts , '' says the consul@@ tant .
`` Li@@ ke in a luxury store ''
the buyer and seller often find each other through friends .
I looked at sites , blo@@ gs , till someone responded , offering me to go to Be@@ go@@ va@@ ya station , where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the `` corner '' so we can negotiate .
I found out the price of the weapon only there
military comm@@ ent@@ ator Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets
to get a weapon , I need someone with connections , says the sales consul@@ tant . - I have an acqu@@ ain@@ tance , but I 'm not sure it 's reliable .
there are sal@@ es@@ men on labour markets , but one needs to `` come '' there condi@@ tionally `` from John Do@@ e , who asked to tell that his daughter lost a to@@ oth . ''
right now , even if I need a few k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le@@ du@@ sters , I get them through someone I trust .
he also supplies them only to me , because he knows that I wo n't give him away .
beginners look for weapons in different ways .
former military man Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid = 1990 's , when he was preparing to publish an article about this .
the formul@@ as are still the same , according to him .
he was given an album of pictures with `` anything and everything . ''
`` I felt like I was in a luxury store , '' he rec@@ alls .
according to Bar@@ an@@ ets , the buyer is not offered a p@@ ig in a po@@ ke - you can try out everything .
I , the potential client , am not just buying ; we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there .
`` I am given the opportunity to shoot , and when I am certain that the weapon is good , we begin to negotiate , '' describes the expert .
store on a sofa
Internet searches lead to sites and `` V@@ Kontakte '' groups , where weapons `` for different purposes '' are on offer .
no documents or personal meetings are needed .
`` It 's enough to have a certain sum of money , '' says the adverti@@ sement heading on the website `` Bu@@ y a pist@@ ol or ri@@ f@@ le . ''
users leave their requests and ask questions .
can a minor buy ?
`` Wi@@ th@@ out a license , of course , '' asks user `` John '' ( name is changed ) .
`` W@@ ant to buy a T@@ T , Moscow , '' conc@@ is@@ ely requests `` F@@ ed@@ or@@ en@@ kov . ''
Federal Security Service now spread a big network of fa@@ ke sites and there are tons of potential bu@@ yers of military weapons .
people come like hung@@ ry fish to ba@@ it , and then mine coal in Si@@ ber@@ ia .
military comm@@ ent@@ ator and former military man Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets
I heard about this : normally the site is registered outside the area of applic@@ ability of the laws of Russia .
people accept orders .
the buyer pays at an AT@@ M .
`` In response , a photo is sent with instructions on where the weapon is hidden , '' says Press Secretary of the Rights to We@@ ap@@ ons non = governmental organization D@@ mit@@ ry K@@ is@@ lov .
Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets confirms that after leaving a request on the site you can stay without a weapon and go to j@@ ail .
the Federal Security Service now sp@@ reads a big network of fa@@ ke sites and there are tons of potential bu@@ yers of military weapons .
`` People are like hung@@ ry fish after ba@@ it , and end in Si@@ ber@@ ia mining coal , '' - he says .
Mak@@ aro@@ v for 100 dollars
when buying illegal fire@@ arms , 100 to 900 dollars is enough according to experts .
according to D@@ mit@@ ry K@@ is@@ lov from the Rights to We@@ ap@@ ons organization , a Mak@@ aro@@ v gun can be acquired for 100 = 300 dollars .
the wait time is a month to a month and a half .
it is shipped from long = term storage ware@@ houses by the mid = level management of these ware@@ houses .
according to official statistics of the authorities , the number of such crimes in Russia on the whole dropped 7 % as compared to January = October 2011 , amoun@@ ting to 2@@ 2,@@ 900 , while the number of cases of the@@ ft and ex@@ tor@@ tion of weapons , amm@@ uni@@ tion , explo@@ sive substances and explo@@ sive devices dropped by 7.@@ 8 % .
fast = food and super@@ market workers are on strike in the U.@@ S.A.
up to a fourth of all American teen@@ agers have worked the cash register at Mc@@ Don@@ ald 's at one time or another
in the last few days , there is a wave of protest actions in the U.@@ S.A. against low sal@@ aries in super@@ markets of the Wal@@ m@@ art chain and popular fast food chain restaurants like Mc@@ Don@@ ald 's , Bur@@ ger King , T@@ aco B@@ ell , W@@ end@@ y 's and K@@ ent@@ u@@ cky Fri@@ ed Chi@@ cken .
right now , nobody is able to pre@@ di@@ ct whether this wave will turn into the n@@ in@@ th wave or it is dest@@ ined to fi@@ zzle out early .
actions are being supported by unions and a series of left = wing organizations .
in addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Wal@@ m@@ art and fast food chains , the goal of the prote@@ sters is to create unions within them .
this sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement yet .
46 c@@ ents a year ?
actions began last week after Th@@ an@@ ks@@ giving , on Black Friday , when massive sales drew millions of people in America , sometimes accompanied by clas@@ hes .
on this day , some employees of the Wal@@ m@@ art corpor@@ ation , which emplo@@ ys 2.2 million people around the world , left their work@@ places and pi@@ ck@@ eted together with the unions and left = wing activists from the corpor@@ ation stores that sell products to people on low = to = medium incomes .
Wal@@ m@@ art s@@ ells everything imagin@@ able , from di@@ apers , hunting ri@@ f@@ les and car batteries , to vacuum clean@@ ers , eggs and milk .
products in its stores are on average 8 % to 27 % cheaper than in major super@@ markets .
so many low = paid Wal@@ m@@ art employees shop only at their workplace .
availability and assort@@ ment made Wal@@ m@@ art one of the biggest American corporations .
according to critics , Wal@@ m@@ art can afford to sell the products che@@ ap@@ ly partly because it pays little to its employees .
these latter also compla@@ in about hard work conditions , for example lack of lift trucks and hand = held scann@@ ers .
prote@@ sters on Black Friday demanded a sal@@ ary increase and compla@@ ined that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corpor@@ ation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month .
a typical Wal@@ m@@ art employee , receiving 9.@@ 5 dollars / hour , can not afford this .
scientists from the Ber@@ kel@@ ey University in California argue that if Wal@@ m@@ art raises the average sal@@ ary to 12 dollars / hour , it will cost the corpor@@ ation 3.2 billion dollars .
this is about 1.1 % more than it sp@@ ends on sal@@ aries right now .
if Wal@@ m@@ art fully shi@@ fts the cost of increasing wages to the shoul@@ ders of consumers , each visit to the store will cost only 46 c@@ ents more .
in one year , they will only spend 12.@@ 39 dollars more than now .
Wal@@ m@@ art supporters happ@@ ily note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the corpor@@ ation .
black Friday continued in its stores from 8 in the evening on Thursday till midnight the next day , and during the period Wal@@ m@@ art sold about 5000 products a second .
in total , its cash regi@@ sters conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday .
representative of the corpor@@ ation , D@@ an Fo@@ gel@@ man , asser@@ ted in an interview with a left = wing site , the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , that a total of `` less than five '' Wal@@ m@@ art employees left the workplace , and the protest act was just `` another PR tri@@ ck '' of the union that organized it .
`` Free cash register ! ''
protests continued this week in New York , where their object was not Wal@@ m@@ art ( they ' re not so welcome in the progressive city , that is why they do n't exist here yet ) , but Mc@@ Don@@ ald 's and other cheap restaurants .
Mc@@ Don@@ ald 's says that it s@@ ells billions of por@@ tions , and despite this it does n't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work !
Ju@@ ma@@ ane Willi@@ ams , member of the City Council of New York
at the moment , the minimum sal@@ ary according to federal and N@@ Y law is 7.@@ 25 dollars an hour .
fast food restaurants increase it with time , but very little . on average their ordinary employees in New York earn 8.@@ 90 dollars / hour .
nobody ear@@ ns less in this expensive city .
I can not understand how one can survive in New York on this money .
once upon a time , almost a fourth of American teen@@ agers went through Mc@@ Don@@ ald 's , working part = time after school , living with parents .
few saw this as a source of living or planned to stay there for long .
now I continuously come across inter@@ views with Mc@@ Don@@ ald 's employees , who compla@@ in that they have to survive on this sal@@ ary and sometimes even feed their children .
on the other hand , there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum , whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them .
participants of the protest that began at 6.@@ 30 a.m. on Thursday near the Mc@@ Don@@ ald 's on 40@@ th street and Ma@@ dis@@ on Avenue demanded that cas@@ hi@@ ers and co@@ o@@ ks of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars / hour , i.e. more than double their present wages .
they also demanded the creation of unions in the fast food industry .
American law prohi@@ bits the administration from preventing this or pun@@ ishing activists of the union movement by n@@ ag@@ ging or fir@@ ing .
on the other hand , the administration does not often ease their life .
but for objective reasons it is hard to cover fast food with a union .
one of them is the unusual turnover of employees .
dis@@ agre@@ eing
noisy protests began on this day in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan .
the highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near Mc@@ Don@@ ald 's by Times Square , where several local democratic politicians spoke out . one of them , Ju@@ ma@@ ane Willi@@ ams , said : `` Mc@@ Don@@ ald 's claims it s@@ ells billions of por@@ tions , and despite this it does n't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work ! ''
demonstr@@ ators were supported by other prominent N@@ Y demo@@ crats , like Bill de Bla@@ si@@ o , a candidate for N@@ Y city may@@ or , who said : `` We need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees , so that they can achieve fair wages and economic well@@ being , which every New Yor@@ ker deserves ! . ''
according to the New York Times , this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry .
but only a few hundred people took part in it , and many of them were not fast food employees , which comp@@ rise tens of thousands of people in New York .
it is unclear right now whether this will spark a mass movement .
`` At the moment , the mind can not be dec@@ eived too well ''
among modern technology fans a popular topic is au@@ g@@ mented reality , lat@@ ely seen primarily through the pr@@ ism of special gl@@ asses .
at first , a functional model was shown by Google in the summer , at its annual conference . then , in November , it was announced that Microsoft filed an application for patent too .
however , according to the conversation with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft , Sha@@ h@@ ra@@ m Iz@@ ad@@ i , gl@@ asses are a thing of the past for scientists in this company .
they are drawn by the prospect of manipul@@ ating virtual objects in the air with bare hands , creating virtual open spaces .
- Ple@@ ase tell us , in simple terms , about the work your research group does .
- We work on the interaction of people with machines , at the same time trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction .
while people in general are stuck at working with pixels on a flat screen and sometimes pointing fin@@ gers at them .
we want to look 5 = 10 years into the future and pre@@ di@@ ct car@@ din@@ al changes in this interaction .
for example , X@@ box and Kin@@ ect sensors are a step forward . almost no X@@ box is sold without Kin@@ ect today , because everyone likes control by gest@@ ures .
- What else awaits us in the future ?
- Des@@ p@@ ite the fact that Kin@@ ect shi@@ fted the interaction to the physical level , much still occurs on a flat screen , sometimes in 3D .
information entry has improved ( the system receives more data ) , but output still needs to get better .
we are trying to change this , working on truly three = dimensional display systems based on various technologies , including projec@@ tion technologies .
we need to let the computer world into our physical world , make it more tangible .
but for this , we need to identify both the user and the space around him .
then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form .
above all , get rid of these st@@ up@@ id virtual reality hel@@ m@@ ets !
- What do you think about voice control ?
it 's a popular thing , but is it over@@ estimated ?
- It clearly can not be called a cure = for = all - there 's a question of privacy , because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and intentions .
in reality , all types of interaction with computers are good , but each in their own nich@@ e .
for example , we had a project to control devices in public places , in which we thought about movements , not wide movements , but small , reserved ones .
movements were not recorded by a camera , but by a hand bra@@ cel@@ et that determined the movement of b@@ ones and mus@@ cles .
it 's big right now , but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch .
in general , the future lies in the mixed control , e.g. movement + voice .
- What do you mean ?
- For example , how would you ask me to give you this bottle of water ?
you will talk and show at the same time .
- U@@ su@@ ally I just say .
- Oh , that will be very hard to detect .
- S@@ o you want to make the users adapt to what the machine can or can not do at that moment ?
- Not necessarily , but it is a mutual approxim@@ ation .
I think in the near future , we will mainly work on developing new sensors that will enable more precise determination of a person 's reaction .
this could be , e.g. laser sensors . they have a decent depth resolution , which is very important .
- If we talk about your work with X@@ box Kin@@ ect sensors , what are your complaints about modern cameras ?
not enough resolution , depth or something else ?
- In general , the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on three = dimensional recognition .
of course , it would be good to have eight me@@ ga pixels with 1000 k / s speed .
it 's not just the me@@ ga pixels , though , but the quality of the mat@@ rix and the depth .
from the latter point of view , all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorith@@ m designers .
so it 's important to remember about the resolution on the X , Y , but also the Z axis .
speed , the number of images per second , is also very important .
human movements are relatively dynamic , and the current 30 k / s is really not enough , especially for gest@@ ures .
Ste@@ ven Ba@@ th@@ iche from our Red@@ mond laboratory created a touch sensor with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms , while modern serial sensors are closer to the latter indicator ( 60 = 100 ) .
not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between man and machine .
in my work , it would be very useful to have a device that does not require tou@@ ching and would have more images per second .
- Do@@ es the number of cameras need to be increased ?
- In Kin@@ ect there are three cameras now , one of which is actually an infra@@ red emit@@ ter and the second one , the recipient of the signal .
the third one is actually a regular sensor of visible range .
it is not applied to determine the object 's depth .
potentially , a large number of cameras could solve the problem ...
or make it worse , by increasing the required volume of calculations .
it would be nice to create a flexible an@@ alogue Kin@@ ect , play with the fle@@ xion of camera dispo@@ sition and see how this will help in three = dimensional determination of the position .
- As far as I remember , Microsoft did not present its gl@@ asses to the public , unlike Google .
do n't you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of au@@ g@@ mented reality technologies ?
- Cer@@ tain@@ ly it is not very convenient to walk around with a smart phone in your raised hands all the time , but I think that the cool@@ est option would be `` transitional '' au@@ g@@ mented reality , where you could shift from gl@@ asses to smart phone , projec@@ tion display , and everywhere else based on a clou@@ d platform .
gl@@ asses are a very personal device , that is their strength ( private things are seen only by you ) and , at the same time , their weakness - au@@ g@@ mented reality based on gl@@ asses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people .
- L@@ et us imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual h@@ olo@@ graphic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Star@@ k from Iron@@ man , but to a regular person .
there is one problem with this idea that the critics often point out : no t@@ acti@@ le feedback !
hands feel nothing !
what answers does your group prepare to this challenge ?
- In my lec@@ tures I often say that au@@ g@@ mented reality is the sevent@@ h con@@ secu@@ tive attempt at the interaction between man and machine .
I think that the eigh@@ th will probably be the addition of t@@ acti@@ le sens@@ ations .
for now , one of the interesting tri@@ cks is to use the second hand as a sort of mat@@ rix for the image .
it is great at regi@@ stering pus@@ hes !
but there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these `` images in the air '' a sense of tan@@ gi@@ bility , for example , the interference of several targeted ultra@@ sound rays in a specific point where the finger is located gives a sen@@ sation , but very weak right now , as if someone ble@@ w on your finger@@ tip .
there are also wr@@ ist bra@@ cel@@ ets that affect the ner@@ ve end@@ ings in fin@@ gers , which is also a promising area .
- Ha@@ ve you tried to dec@@ eive the mind ?
to force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees something ?
- This is a good idea and we have n't tried this yet .
it conce@@ als one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person , who is physi@@ cally in a very limited space to believe that he is walking along an open , almost limit@@ less space ; we are working on the concept of tre@@ ad@@ mil@@ ls ( not at all like in clubs ) , moving platforms , and giant bal@@ lo@@ ons .
so far dec@@ ei@@ ving the mind has had limited success , there 's work for many years to come .
that 's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very beginn@@ ings .

the new player in Ros@@ bal@@ t - the bold artist Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler .
the whole city knows Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler , a be@@ ar@@ ded man d@@ ressed all in red , who can be seen by the Russian Museum , or by the Summer Garden , or at fashionable parties and shows .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler 's work always brings in crow@@ ds of people , no matter where they are exhi@@ bited .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosop@@ hi@@ cal stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers and cre@@ ators of new my@@ th@@ ology .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler is an outstanding man of the St. Petersburg av@@ ant = gar@@ de of the late 80 's early 90 's .
moreover , he is a city man , who makes people smile on the street and lifts up everyone 's spirit .
recently he took up the street organ and became St. Petersburg 's music man , because he was ready for this complex role with all his Boh@@ em@@ ian existence , philosophy and image .
- Ki@@ ri@@ ll , why do you walk around the city all in red , not yellow or tur@@ quo@@ ise , for example ?
- I chose the colour red as a fashion designer engaged in look and image .
in this world , red is a compromise between artist , image = maker and society .
although in society , everything that is not grey causes aggres@@ sion and ag@@ itation of the bad kind .
but my pro@@ voc@@ ations are aimed at starting conversation .
the whole history of my pro@@ voc@@ ative actions is an invitation to discussion .
- W@@ hen did you realise that you must be an artist ?
- At an exhibition in the Nev@@ sky House of Culture , where my work was displayed .
it became clear to me that this is my path .
then , the wave of older free , un@@ official artists was gone , while new , free artists like me were not understood .
I became friends with the artists of the new wave , with post = Gaza = Nev@@ sky style artists ( `` post = gaz@@ on@@ ev@@ sch@@ ina '' ) , which led to P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ aya = 10 , and the wave was no longer .
I 'm drawn to theatre , clothing , music , all gen@@ res except for literature .
- And all this has been united in your Art = clin@@ ic ... - It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg , where all the best creative forces should come together .
in 1995 , I occupied the territory on P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ aya = 10 , and while the renovation work had not started , there was a musical and creative club , a Boh@@ em@@ ian club , the house of the St. Petersburg Boh@@ em@@ ia .
many were born there : nom@@ y , Te@@ qu@@ ila Jazz , I remember when Sh@@ nur was brought there with the Van Go@@ gh 's E@@ ar project .
Sh@@ nur and his friends lip s@@ ang easy songs , wearing tight le@@ ot@@ ards , and the now trendy compos@@ er I@@ g@@ or V@@ do@@ vin was with them .
when the group began to play live , it became Len@@ ingrad .
Tra@@ k@@ h@@ ten@@ berg was the present@@ er of many programs before hal@@ i = Gal@@ i times .
we gave them Tra@@ k@@ h@@ ten@@ berg , and a great career was on its way , but the basic education and ment@@ oring he received from us .
gallery D 137 , Gri@@ bo@@ ye@@ do@@ v club - all these echo the Art = clin@@ ic .
that is where our staff and regular customers left for .
I am a her@@ o of the last century , when culture meant something .
in 2000 , there was a pol@@ l in the press , for the People of Our City prize .
I was nom@@ inated Arti@@ st of the Year , my cli@@ max came to an end .
in the new times , it is un@@ comfortable to work by old rules . I 'm a man of truth , honest@@ y and culture of the last century .
in our time , it is easy to become popular , but culture and popularity are different . you can be popular , but not very cultural .
- Your work is marked by a recogni@@ z@@ able style .
- M@@ any of my works are h@@ its , with clearly reflected relevance and ac@@ u@@ ity .
I will have a programme exhi@@ bit , `` Russian museum in clo@@ wns . ''
clo@@ wns are a tim@@ eless category .
I was social before , now it is painful and sc@@ ary to be like that .
but everything is bl@@ ur@@ red in clo@@ wns , tragedy is removed .
I like gro@@ tes@@ que , I have gro@@ tes@@ que ideas .
for example , saving the world by totalit@@ arian changing of clothes by order .
nowadays , people are judged by appearance , not their inner qualities .
who knows , maybe you can not sha@@ ke his hand , and need to sp@@ it in his face .
and the lie will go away with the help of changing clothes .
- Rec@@ ently we saw you in the role of music man . - A cultural city should have such a character .
who fits the role better than I ?
- May@@ be commercial art can also be beautiful ?
- No@@ wadays , commercial art should be ne@@ at , consider@@ ate , sweet .
there is a disin@@ te@@ gration of cultures .
people used to get together in flo@@ cks , Boh@@ em@@ ians liked one thing , the simple people , something else .
now , everybody is divided into micro societies , it 's hard to be liked by everyone .
I am not a hundred dollar bill to please all .
now you have to think who you will please .
now , each cul@@ t her@@ o has 100 fans .
- Bu@@ t several thousand come to ST@@ AS Mik@@ ha@@ i@@ lov !
- The cast = outs go to see him , the sexual = social sphere is at work there .
but 300 people will come for culture , not 10,000 . in the end , there 's less management , money , everything dies out .
I have fans ; the main thing is not to betra@@ y them , not to spo@@ il what I have earned .
in my youth , I painted such art that one collec@@ tor had it han@@ ging on the same wall with Fal@@ k and L@@ ari@@ on@@ ov .
I started with paintings , which people usually end with .
concepts are often mixed up these days .
people say : spiritual culture , consumer culture .
there is no culture in consu@@ mer@@ ism , it 's `` from another opera . ''
I am a man of yesterday 's culture . I grew up on examples of artists who lived poor and died in poverty , refused money for the sake of painting .
this is the culture I 'm for .
- Ki@@ ri@@ ll , what is St. Petersburg missing ?
- Good cultural experts .
there is such a thing : an official for culture .
but not everyone can be engaged in culture .
under the right rul@@ ers everything was different . kings may not have understood culture very well , but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts .
there are good consultants in Moscow right now .
here in St. Petersburg , there are people who could be experts , but they are pushed to the side , because more advanced experts are needed , who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them .
jud@@ gement calls are what thri@@ ve now .
even Er@@ art , but they ' re different because they say honest@@ ly that we do n't accept all modern art . there are some artists , who need to find other museums for themselves .
- What does St. Petersburg mean to you ?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital , Moscow has much more culture , there is bed@@ rock there .
it 's hard for art to grow on our rocks .
we need cultural bed@@ rock , but we now have more writers than readers . this is wrong .
in Europe , there are many cur@@ ious people , who go to art exhi@@ bits , concerts .
here , this layer is thin .
we need to make art fashionable , as it was in the beginning of last century .
the project is supported by the St. Petersburg grant .
give birth in space
the earth is in danger .
global warming or an encounter with a kil@@ ler ast@@ ero@@ id .
car@@ av@@ ans of cos@@ mic ships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet .
to save humanity , the question is how to prop@@ ag@@ ate our race in conditions of wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness or on that replacement planet ?
I think the choice is small .
there are only two actual plan@@ ets that can be explo@@ red even hypo@@ the@@ tically .
`` Ven@@ us and Mars , '' says Sen@@ ior Res@@ ear@@ cher of the P.@@ K. Sh@@ tern@@ berg State A@@ stronom@@ y Institute ( G@@ A@@ IS@@ h ) V@@ ladimir Sur@@ din .
but while conditions on Mars are more appropriate for life , Ven@@ us has 500 = degree temperatures .
life is possible only at a high altitude or on the or@@ bit of Ven@@ us ... in space .
the question of reproduction in space began with flora .
half a century ago , experiments were run on plants .
four generations of pe@@ as grown in or@@ bit were no different from their earth counter@@ parts .
then , in@@ sec@@ ts were b@@ red in or@@ bit , small fruit f@@ lies .
in 1979 , qu@@ ail eggs were sent to space , to check how an embr@@ yo develops in wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness .
we get an absolutely normal ch@@ ick .
but then the problem begins .
`` The problem is related to the fact that this ch@@ ick needs to find support , needs to get on its feet and start moving , '' explains head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Bi@@ ological Problems ( IM@@ B@@ P ) RA@@ N V@@ ladimir Sy@@ che@@ v .
having found no support , chi@@ cks were t@@ umb@@ ling around in dis@@ order .
after 10 hours , the new@@ bor@@ ns experienced complete at@@ rop@@ hy of inst@@ inc@@ ts .
chi@@ cks did not react to light and sound .
and the problem was that they simply died after four days .
`` We b@@ red chi@@ cks twice there , and then stopped , because it is impossible to work with them there , '' says V@@ ladimir Sy@@ che@@ v , confir@@ ming the failure of the experiment with chi@@ cks in space .
the last biological `` mini = ar@@ k '' with animals fle@@ w into or@@ bit 16 years ago .
in spring 2013 , experiments will continue .
however , only same = sex beings will be on the B@@ ion bio = satellite .
there was an experiment with rats , who were sent to space with fo@@ etus .
in principle , there was nothing extraordinary there .
`` This was on bio = satelli@@ tes , but again , it was a sing@@ ular experiment and such research needs to be conducted , '' says V@@ ladimir Sy@@ che@@ v .
after landing , the cos@@ mic rats had bab@@ ies .
but it 's hard to solve the problem of reproduction directly in space .
it 's not an easy task .
animals simply can not follow their sexual inst@@ in@@ ct , when they ' re out of their familiar environment .
in principle , people , unlike animals , can .
Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ iens have abstra@@ ct thinking , and are able to create a fitting emotional background .
such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons .
but women have been flying to space for 50 years .
the biggest risk was for Ter@@ es@@ h@@ ko@@ va .
the most valuable thing for humanity is the female body .
our `` Se@@ ag@@ ull '' left and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be OK after flying to space .
whether she will be able to give birth after this flight .
`` No@@ body answered this question , '' says ro@@ cket and space industry veter@@ an , V@@ ak@@ ht@@ ang V@@ ach@@ n@@ ad@@ ze .
in June 1964 , only a year after flying to space , the first woman in space Val@@ ent@@ ina Ter@@ es@@ h@@ ko@@ va gave birth to a daughter .
the child 's father , An@@ dri@@ an Nikol@@ ae@@ v , was also a cos@@ mon@@ aut .
in 1988 , the second woman cos@@ mon@@ aut , S@@ vet@@ lana Sav@@ it@@ sk@@ aya , who went into or@@ bit twice and even worked in open space , gave birth to a son .
however , the risk remains .
we have few , very few cos@@ mon@@ au@@ ts , who were OK and had healthy children after long flights .
`` What 's more , it is dangerous even for or@@ bit@@ al flights , '' adds pilot and cos@@ mon@@ aut , Her@@ o of the US@@ SR , Her@@ o of Russia , Val@@ ery Poli@@ ak@@ ov .
and yet , humanity needs to seek out some new aven@@ ues in bio@@ technologies , protection from radiation , creation of artificial gra@@ vity .
hy@@ dro = laboratory of CP@@ K - mandatory phase of training for a flight .
here , cos@@ mon@@ au@@ ts practice skills of working in open space in zero = gra@@ vity conditions .
water im@@ it@@ ates wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness .
if for adults water is a foreign medium , although comfortable , for in@@ fan@@ ts it is a native element .
small amp@@ hi@@ bi@@ ans seem to confirm that life came to land from the ocean .
there is a connection with the fact that an inf@@ ant sp@@ ends about 9 months in am@@ ni@@ o@@ tic flu@@ id in the wom@@ b ; it is easier to get used to water after that .
in principle , it is logical , because only two weeks pass from birth until the first bathing .
`` This is very little time to forget something , '' says inf@@ ant swimming instruc@@ tor Marina Ak@@ sen@@ ova .
in other words , if for a new@@ born wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness is more natural , a woman needs gra@@ vity , earth 's pull .
stom@@ ach and pel@@ vic mus@@ cles usually quickly de@@ generate in wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness ; the ability to push out the embr@@ yo is reduced .
well , let 's assume that child@@ birth stimul@@ ators will work out .
maybe she will push out the baby in a special room .
`` T@@ hen what ? '' - asks Val@@ ery Poli@@ ak@@ ov about this non = tri@@ vi@@ al issue .
on the other hand , a baby also needs artificial gra@@ vity .
when a body does not feel the earth 's pull , it does not form the sk@@ el@@ et@@ al and mus@@ cular system .
it is not possible to dress a new@@ born in or@@ bit into a special loading suit for training , as they do with adults .
he will simply not have what he needs to survive .
`` And this experiment , that we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment , will lead to us bringing a han@@ dic@@ apped , completely un@@ adapted human to earth , '' predic@@ ts Chairman of the Committee on Bio@@ ethics IM@@ B@@ P RA@@ N I@@ g@@ or P@@ est@@ ov .
for the moment , birth of children in space is just a theory .
however , with time , it will become reality , when earth@@ lings will go to a far@@ away planet in their ships , and it will become the home for their off@@ spring , who were born in space .
N@@ K@@ U Head : S@@ var@@ c System audit has failed because of politicians .
the Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts , but it lags behind in their application .
this was said by Mi@@ los@@ la@@ v Kal@@ a , vice = president of the Su@@ preme Au@@ dit Office ( N@@ K@@ U ) in an interview for Aktu@@ al@@ ne@@ .@@ c@@ z.
`` The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion , '' states Kal@@ a , comm@@ enting on the current situation .
similar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and German audi@@ tors .
as an example of impro@@ per practice , they c@@ ite Pet@@ r N@@ ec@@ as 's approach to the so = called `` S@@ var@@ c System . ''
the Prime Minister recently claimed that the O@@ DS will not be bur@@ dening business owners with its checks - so is it forbidden or allowed ?
`` The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohi@@ bits something , then even the Government 's head can not prevent the work of its department , which is duty = bound to monitor and enforce , '' asser@@ ts Kal@@ a .
at the audit committee 's session in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties , you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany , within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared .
what exactly was this about ?
this is about parallel audi@@ ting , which we began around two years ago .
simply put , this is about how European legislation govern@@ s the handling of public contracts , followed by individual state legisl@@ ations and then the actual practice itself .
we brought all this together , and although the audit is not yet complete , some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms , our legislation might be even `` more conc@@ ise and complete , '' however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in Germany .
this confirms that creating more and more conc@@ ise rules is not enough , and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws .
what does this project actually help you with , and what do you think its outcome will bring ?
this kind of joint audit could contribute to cur@@ ta@@ iling these efforts to specify our law , to reduce and perfect boundaries , when it does not have such a positive impact .
economy means acqu@@ iring the required thing at a reasonable ( which does not always mean the lowest ) price , so that profit@@ e@@ ering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided .
however , just because we have reduced the order limits , does not mean something will be pro@@ cu@@ red .
the system might become over@@ loaded with the amount of pap@@ er@@ work , and those , who wish to look for lo@@ op@@ holes in it , will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher .
these are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation relating to public contracts .
how does the audit system work in Germany ?
is there an office like the N@@ K@@ U , or is it organised differently ?
as far as the office is concerned , the Bundes@@ rechn@@ ung@@ shof functions like our N@@ K@@ U , and it is organised like ours , it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently , but basically both offices operate similarly .
powers are also similar to a degree , though of course Germany is organised feder@@ ally , so these courts of audi@@ tors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly diff@@ ers from our own .
the BR@@ H can only audit federal money , known to us as state funds .
public funds , which , for us , are administ@@ ered by regional and municipal authorities , are audi@@ ted by the federal courts of audi@@ tors there .
when it comes to their legislation , is it more straightforward than ours ?
overall , I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data , nevertheless in certain respects Germany serves as an example , but it certainly can not be said that it is better in every aspect .
is this because , perhaps , they have better enforcement ?
that is certainly not true , but again , I prefer not to make such compar@@ isons .
it should be said that even in a country we perc@@ eive as exempl@@ ary , they encounter a whole range of problems .
if that were not the case , they would gain nothing from working with our office , would they ?
coming back to domestic legislation , what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office , is its impact being felt already ?
the period since the amendment came into force has been quite short , so it has not manifest@@ ed itself in our audit work yet .
since we carry out our audi@@ ts ex = post , a certain delay has to be taken into account .
as yet , we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audi@@ ts - we have launched our new `` fiscal failure risk detection '' system , with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts , and these have been analy@@ sed - that is where changes will clearly be seen , because of the changed limits , the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes , and so on .
so do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit , or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system ?
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction , and I hope this will be confirmed .
a problem , which may arise here , is that the law becomes `` too constra@@ ined '' and will not be enfor@@ ce@@ able .
under the previous rules , parties being audi@@ ted were already bound by their audit provider ( for example , in the case of regional operational programmes , the regional office ) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline .
is it worth constra@@ ining the law in this way , in that case ?
I do not think this is the way .
the system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it , but not pen@@ alise those , who make a mistake on a techn@@ ic@@ ality , which does not affect the final decision .
this kind of system will only increase pressure on bureaucracy .
so how can we get out of this ?
let 's see where this dead = end takes us .
the Prime Minister recently said the O@@ DS will not be bur@@ dening business@@ men with audi@@ ts of the so = called `` S@@ var@@ c System '' - what does this mean ?
is the S@@ var@@ c System prohibited or allowed ?
the Law must be set out one way or the other , and if it prohi@@ bits something , then even the Government 's head can not prevent the work of its department , which is duty = bound to monitor and enforce .
he may say : `` L@@ et us change this law and relax it , '' but he can not say we should pre@@ tend it is not there .
the law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the formali@@ ties which must be adher@@ ed to - which is the right way to ensure public ten@@ ders are protected .
on the other hand , it is a tragedy , when a bi@@ d@@ der with the best offer is excluded on a techn@@ ic@@ ality .
the Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion .
roads are ic@@ y in places , but mostly pass@@ able .
in several places in the Czech Republic , the main roads are ic@@ y and snow@@ y .
however , the majority of roads are pass@@ able , with extra care needed in places .
Carl@@ s@@ bad region
in the Carl@@ s@@ bad region , the roads have been usable this morning , though in some places they were ic@@ y and snow@@ y .
the temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero , though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day .
s@@ no@@ wing in the region has stopped , and only a thin layer of snow remains in the low@@ lands .
however , the ri@@ dges of the Kr@@ us@@ ne Mountains have around 30 cen@@ timet@@ res of snow .
in some locations there is limited visibility due to m@@ ist , according to the local highway service .
the R@@ 6 high = speed motorway and primary roads in the region are now usable without restriction .
caution is , of course , appropriate , for example , on certain bridges , where the surface can be ic@@ y and sli@@ p@@ per@@ y .
all secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads are also pass@@ able , including mountain roads .
in certain stret@@ ches of these roads there might be remaining frozen and comp@@ acted snow pat@@ ches .
above all , at higher levels , extra care should be taken while driving .
Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce and H@@ ra@@ dec Kr@@ alo@@ ve region
on some roads in Eastern Boh@@ em@@ ia , there might be a risk of black ice , at higher al@@ titudes and in the mountains there might be a layer of comp@@ acted snow , according to the Road and Motor@@ way Direc@@ torate .
the highway service is warning the drivers against black ice , which might occur at higher al@@ titudes of the Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce region in particular .
black ice may occur around Lan@@ sk@@ rou@@ n , U@@ st@@ i n@@ ad Or@@ lic@@ i , Poli@@ cky , S@@ vit@@ av@@ y , and V@@ y@@ so@@ ke My@@ to , and particularly on secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads .
the I / 43 and I / 34 roads have been chem@@ ically treated around S@@ vit@@ av@@ y .
snow is particularly affecting the roads in the Kr@@ kon@@ ose and Or@@ li@@ cke mountains .
at higher al@@ titudes , there is a comp@@ acted snow layer on the roads around Ry@@ chno@@ v n@@ ad K@@ ne@@ z@@ no@@ u and Tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
in Eastern Boh@@ em@@ ia the day will be mostly clear to partly clou@@ dy , and dry .
temperatures will be between min@@ us three and plus one degree Cel@@ si@@ us mostly , with a light wind .
Pil@@ sen region
the roads in the Pil@@ sen region have been usable this morning , with extra care needed in some places . drivers should take the weather conditions into account .
the morning will be fro@@ sty , with temperatures ranging between three and nine degrees below zero .
due to the existing snow and subsequent drop in temperature , certain roads may be ic@@ y .
drivers should expect m@@ ist in places , though visibility will gradually improve .
this information was reported by the region 's highway service .
the D@@ 5 motorway is dri@@ vable almost without restriction , but the road services recommend extra caution between the 80@@ th and 13@@ 1st kilomet@@ re marks .
most primary road surfaces are dry and fro@@ st = free .
southern areas of the Pil@@ sen and T@@ ach@@ ov regions may have ic@@ y pat@@ ches .
secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads are wet , and may therefore also have ic@@ y pat@@ ches .
drivers should be cau@@ tious especially on less frequ@@ ented roads in the Boh@@ em@@ ian Forest .
Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region
drivers should expect snow s@@ lush on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region .
it is a result of the chemical treatment carried out at Cer@@ ven@@ oh@@ or@@ k@@ se se@@ d@@ lo and on the way to Vi@@ del@@ sky Kri@@ z .
snow@@ pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ s were brought out by falling snow overnight , the Sum@@ per@@ k region , according to highway maintenance , got around three cen@@ timet@@ res of snow .
in other parts of the region , roads are mainly pass@@ able without restrictions .
" in the Sum@@ per@@ k region , traces of snow have remained at the highest al@@ titudes .
drivers should expect snow s@@ lush at Cer@@ ven@@ oh@@ or@@ s@@ ke se@@ d@@ lo in the direction of Jes@@ en@@ ik , " the dispat@@ ch officer for the Sum@@ per@@ k highway service told CT@@ K today .
their Jes@@ en@@ ik counter@@ parts also made an ou@@ ting overnight ; the roads all the way to the highest al@@ titudes are now clear and wet following the chemical treatment , according to them .
the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region 's roads are usable without restriction , while in the area of Stern@@ ber@@ k drivers should be@@ ware in woo@@ ded areas , where roads have remained wet .
U@@ st@@ i n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m region , Liber@@ ec region
since this morning , the snow@@ pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ s have reported several places , which are difficult to pass in northern Boh@@ em@@ ia .
besides certain snow = covered places , or some ic@@ y fro@@ st pat@@ ches , the mountain road from Tel@@ nice to Kn@@ ini@@ ce in the U@@ st@@ i n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m region is also closed , according to the police database .
temperatures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain snow@@ y and ic@@ y . in the low@@ lands , however , particularly sou@@ theast of the Central Boh@@ em@@ ian U@@ pl@@ ands , there are no problems and roads are mostly dry .
no traffic hold = ups have so far been reported .
ic@@ y fro@@ st pat@@ ches have been reported in particular by road maintenance around Ste@@ ti .
according to me@@ te@@ or@@ ologists the conditions for this were perfect - rain and mel@@ ting snow during the day , with a clear night and free@@ zing temperatures .
adverse conditions are expected on the main sections of the I / 13 road between the U@@ st@@ i n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m and Liber@@ ec regions .
the closure of the Tel@@ nice to Kn@@ ini@@ ce road was caused by bent tree branches , which were weigh@@ ed down to road level by snow@@ fall .
Simon Or@@ n@@ est : at the concerts we want a fusion of positive energy
what is your opinion on the end of the world that might come in less than a month ?
it is just another star@@ t@@ ler , which we like to lat@@ ch on to .
together with The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band , we tend to jo@@ ke about it , saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or aver@@ t the end of the world completely .
in December you are even organising a unique series of three concerts against the end of the world .
can you give our readers some details on this ?
this is a nation@@ wide fund = raising event , which we have been planning for the past two years .
we decided to make use of the marketing potential of the end of the May@@ an calendar , due on the 21st of December at 11 : 10 a.m.
on the eve , the 20th of December , at 9@@ pm , 3 concerts will take place in parallel in Prague , Br@@ no , and O@@ stra@@ va .
they will end at around the time when Ki@@ ri@@ b@@ ati Island in the Pacific , which is 12 hours ahead of us , reaches the end of the May@@ an calendar .
who came up with this idea ?
initially it was probably my idea , later we worked all the details out with our designer , Hon@@ za Augu@@ sta .
apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world , we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet , when we , one day , hand it over to our children .
on the occasion of the end of the May@@ an calendar , we have also prepared a range of unique items , shoes , t = shir@@ ts , bags , and original keys against the end of the world , which can be purchased at www.@@ e = ta@@ p.@@ cz to support our cause .
the Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band , together with other artists , also recorded the so = called an@@ them against the end of the world , called `` The End of the World is cancelled . ''
it is already well received on YouTube , will it figure at the fund = raising concerts ?
of course , for the grand fin@@ ale , as long as the world does not end be@@ fore@@ hand .
it will be sung by all the artists at all the three concerts at the same time .
the an@@ them will also be featured in a unique live broadcast on Czech Tel@@ evision .
the words were written and the role of Jesus in the video clip was played by T@@ omas Han@@ ak , X@@ ind@@ l X also sings in it ...
how did you end up working with them ?
we collabor@@ ate also with other person@@ alities of the Czech cultural scene , due to organising a lot of fund = raising events and concerts ...
we try to really get them involved in these projects .
it turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us .
what will the proce@@ eds from the concert against the end of the world go to ?
equi@@ pping the whe@@ el@@ chair = accessible educational Stu@@ de@@ o centre , which is already in its sixth year , in collaboration with the citizens association Ta@@ p from the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute for the disabled .
tut@@ ors come in regularly to spend time with the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute 's students and run activities , which they enjoy and interest them .
the students themselves do not have the funds to afford tut@@ ors , so we try to provide this for them in this way .
within the construction project at the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute , a separate building is planned , which we can move into with this project .
every concert sees the appearance of several bands and artists .
how do you select them ?
we have tried to comp@@ ile a programme , which speaks for all ages , including children .
for example , in Prague , Chin@@ as@@ ki , Support les@@ bi@@ ens , Illu@@ str@@ ato@@ sphere with D@@ an Bar@@ ta , The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p , M@@ arian Ban@@ go and J@@ ir@@ i Such@@ y will appear .
further details can be found at www.@@ k@@ p@@ ks@@ .@@ c@@ z.
are you planning any more `` bom@@ b@@ astic events '' in the future ?
in May , we will be making our first appearance in the Prague Spring , so we will definitely be preparing a good line = up with some interesting guests .
next year , we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York , and I personally - since we will be in the USA - would like to build in appe@@ ar@@ ances in Washington and Chicago .
your international plans are not modest ; you have already performed , for instance , in Madrid , Brussels , London , and Moscow .
the Ta@@ p Ta@@ p is nonetheless a band composed of han@@ dic@@ apped people .
how do you cope with these jour@@ neys in terms of logistics and organisation ?
it is not as sc@@ ary as it might seem at first .
we have five members in electric whe@@ el@@ chairs , which must be transported in the luggage area ; we must also , of course , carry around with us a lot of luggage and instrument cases ...
nevertheless , we have so far managed it without any problems , C@@ SA and British Airways were well prepared for us , so much so that , on occasion , I was quite surprised .
even in Moscow , which we have just returned from , it all went smoothly .
thanks to these international trips , you will have had a chance to compare specific accessibility issues , public attitudes to dis@@ ability and so on .
what have been your experiences so far ?
after Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other places , where everything functions better than here , we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its beginn@@ ings .
compared to Prague , Moscow is rather in@@ accessible ; it still remains unusual there for a person in an electric whe@@ el@@ chair to be travelling around the city centre on his or her own .
obvious things , such as giving whe@@ el@@ chairs priority in lifts , are not comm@@ on@@ place there .
fortunately , citizens associations are emerging there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities .
and on the other hand , where do we still lag behind more advanced countries ?
there are a lot of things , which we still lag behind on ...
it is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are affected .
in London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious handi@@ cap@@ s to be independently out in public , and they can use the toi@@ lets , go to the museum , or wherever ...
it is less common there for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life , in this respect with The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p we are a step ahead !
public respect or accessibility is one thing , but it is only when we can become famous athle@@ tes , artists , actors , politicians , or lawyers that things will really begin to change .
so far there are only exceptional cases , people who are strong = will@@ ed .
the Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band is currently very popular , but let us look back a few years , what promp@@ ted you in 1998 to form it ?
I began my job as a tut@@ or at the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute , where I was surrounded by a lot of young people , who were interested in doing something .
since I am a musi@@ cian myself - among others I play the sa@@ x@@ oph@@ one - I started a music club with a colleague .
with time , as our moder@@ ator Lad@@ ya Angel@@ o@@ vic says , it has grown a little out of our control ( lau@@ gh ) .
your popularity has only come about in the last few years , or am I mistak@@ en ?
it is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous sin@@ gers and also by our pro@@ active work on promoting the band .
we realised that work , which goes on un@@ seen can be like it never existed .
thanks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality tut@@ ors , equipment and so on .
was it your goal to take The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p to such hei@@ ghts ?
from the outset , I felt there was potential to do things a little differently .
show business is filled with things , where one im@@ it@@ ates the other .
it is logical in its own way ; all new things are taken in hes@@ it@@ antly and take a long time .
things , which are unique , are few and far between , but I would dare to claim that Ta@@ p Ta@@ p is one of those things .
a person 's first impression on seeing you is , of course , pity - it is a natural reaction ...
but that pity is simply wa@@ sted , because han@@ dic@@ apped people are not abandoned and suffering beings , who need to be pi@@ tied .
they are people , who can fully live life and blo@@ s@@ som , assuming , of course , that they have the right environment for it .
I say that when a person with a handi@@ cap succ@@ ee@@ ds in something , it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole .
has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader , as many people are suggest@@ ing ?
if we want to achieve top class work , we must be un@@ com@@ promising in many things and require a certain level of discipline .
I think this is to be expected .
some people come to us with a romantic idea and their head in the clou@@ ds , and when they find out they have to go to re@@ hear@@ s@@ als twice a week , attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concerts , their enthusiasm quickly dis@@ appears .
that is how it works everywhere , with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something .
the Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band currently has twenty members .
how many of those were present at the beginning in 1998 ?
only one , Lad@@ ya Angel@@ o@@ vic .
we are an open group , people come and people go , this is un@@ avoid@@ able .
those who have the interest and the drive will always find our door open .
the event takes place the day before the end of the world is expected , on Thursday 20.@@ 12.@@ 2012 from 9@@ pm .
the venues will be Pra@@ ha IN@@ CH@@ EB@@ A , Br@@ no Fle@@ da , and O@@ stra@@ va P@@ ly@@ no@@ j@@ em with performances from 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic .
all three cities will be joined by a tel@@ ev@@ ised link = up at the evening 's close for a united ren@@ dition of The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p 's an@@ them `` The End of the World is cancelled ''
the concert 's goal is to raise funds to equi@@ p the ST@@ U@@ DE@@ O multi = functional wheel = chair accessible learning centre at the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute in Prague in the sum of 25 million Czech cro@@ wns .
admission fee to the concert is 400 C@@ Z@@ K , children under 12 years of age go free , tickets on sale from Boh@@ em@@ i@@ ati@@ cket .
Poland and the Co@@ smo@@ s .
last week the council of ministers of the European Space Agency admitted Poland as the t@@ wen@@ tieth member of the agency , being the second nation from the former Eastern Block ( after the Czech Republic , which became a fully fle@@ dged member of the ES@@ A on the 12th of November 2008 ) .
Poland began close cooperation with the ES@@ A in 1994 , and in the following years it has participated in a series of agency projects .
of course , Poland 's path to the space had begun much earlier .
Polish bo@@ ff@@ ins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War , but were not always met with understanding .
I look back , for instance , to the lec@@ ture of A Stern@@ feld in Warsaw 's astronom@@ y ob@@ servatory , who , on the 6th of December 19@@ 33 , presented ideas on his pione@@ ering work En@@ try into space .
the thoughts of the young engine@@ er ( born 19@@ 05 ) left his audience cold , and years later Stern@@ feld remember@@ ed that only Dr. Jan Gad@@ om@@ ski had shown an interest in his work .
in 19@@ 34 , for his work En@@ try into space , Stern@@ feld received the Robert E@@ sn@@ ault = Pel@@ ter@@ ie and Andr@@ e Louis Hir@@ sch prize in France .
the above mentioned Dr. Jan Gad@@ om@@ ski ( 18@@ 99 - 1966 ) later became a strong promo@@ ter of astronom@@ y and a@@ stron@@ au@@ tics .
he published hundreds of articles in Polish journ@@ als , and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects .
Gad@@ om@@ ski became a world = known promo@@ ter of a@@ stron@@ au@@ tics and his contribution was , notably , recognised when a cr@@ ater on the far side of the Mo@@ on was named after him .
in 19@@ 25 , Poland had already built a hand@@ car which was supposed to be fitted with a ro@@ cket engine .
unfortunately , both the project 's designer , and the project 's details , are unknown .
it is not even clear , whether the ro@@ cket was intended to start the hand@@ car or to slow it down .
information about this rail track is only known from press articles of the time .
in 19@@ 33 the Polish arti@@ ll@@ ery started their engagement in flying bom@@ bs .
the research was undertaken by the We@@ ap@@ ons Technology Division in collaboration with Prof. Mi@@ ec@@ zy@@ s@@ law Wolf@@ ke and Prof. Gu@@ sta@@ w M@@ ok@@ r@@ zy@@ ck@@ i .
from the documents , it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests .
of course , the advance of the German army interrupted the research .
in 19@@ 37 , the concept of a photo@@ electric hom@@ ing ro@@ cket designed by engine@@ er Ro@@ ho@@ zin@@ ski appeared in the trade press , and in the following year The Ro@@ cket - air tor@@ pe@@ do and flying ro@@ cket = bom@@ b appeared , au@@ tho@@ red by Le@@ li@@ w@@ y = Kr@@ y@@ w@@ ob@@ lock@@ i .
both projects were dest@@ ined for military use of ro@@ cket engines .
immediately prior to the War , all projects for military use of ro@@ cket technologies were over@@ seen by the Pro@@ visi@@ onal Scienti@@ fic Ad@@ visory Board ( Ty@@ m@@ cz@@ as@@ ow@@ y Komit@@ et Dor@@ ad@@ c@@ zo = Nau@@ ko@@ w@@ y ) that coordinated all the work .
the Board was appointed in 19@@ 37 , but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War .
further work devoted to a@@ stron@@ au@@ tics appeared in the Polish Press after the War thanks to the Polish A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Company ( Pol@@ sk@@ ie To@@ war@@ z@@ yst@@ wo A@@ stron@@ au@@ ty@@ cz@@ ne ) .
the first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the magazine Problems in 195@@ 4 , in which four in = depth articles are on the subject of a@@ stron@@ au@@ tics .
in one of these , by Prof. Su@@ bo@@ to@@ wi@@ cz , the establishment of a company is proposed , which would dedic@@ ate itself to a@@ stron@@ au@@ tics .
at the time , there were already projects under@@ way for artificial satelli@@ tes and it was clear that cos@@ mic research was an emerging sector .
from the beginning of 1956 , the Polish A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Company ( PT@@ A ) sought entry to the International A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Federation ( est . 195@@ 1 ) and by autumn the PT@@ A was already a full member .
in the following year , the PT@@ A 's first chairman , Kaz@@ im@@ ier@@ z Zar@@ an@@ k@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz ( 19@@ 02 - 195@@ 9 ) was appointed Dep@@ uty Chairman for the International A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Federation .
he served in this capacity until his death in 195@@ 9 .
from 1956 , the PT@@ A played a significant role in the successful development of me@@ te@@ or@@ ological ro@@ ckets R@@ M ( Rak@@ i@@ eta Me@@ te@@ or@@ ologi@@ cz@@ na ) , which became the first Polish ro@@ cket to enable scientific research .
the first R@@ M = 1 model was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on the 10th of October 195@@ 8 .
the ro@@ cket , with a ceiling of 1800 metres , measured around 80 cm in length and weigh@@ ed a little under 5 kg .
later , the improved R@@ M = 1@@ A version was constructed and in the summer of 195@@ 9 launch tests were initiated for the two = stage R@@ M = 2 ro@@ cket in the Ble@@ dow@@ sky Des@@ ert .
the ro@@ cket was 1.4 metres in length and weigh@@ ed approximately 11.@@ 5 kg .
a further development model was designed for real scientific work - the R@@ M = 34 ro@@ cket was to reach 14.@@ 5 km and be t@@ asked with monitoring high altitude winds .
of course , in 1962 further research was stopped .
the successor to the R@@ M ro@@ cket type was the Me@@ te@@ or = 1 ro@@ cket , developed from 1962 to 1965 .
the ro@@ cket was designed as a two = stage ro@@ cket , with a total length of 5@@ 10 cm and a launch weight of 3@@ 2.5 kg .
three models were developed ( designated Me@@ te@@ or = 1@@ A , -@@ 1@@ B , and -@@ 1@@ C ) , which differ@@ ed in the room available for scientific appar@@ atus .
in the Me@@ te@@ or = 1@@ A ro@@ cket , a space of 0.@@ 4 lit@@ res was available , Me@@ te@@ or = 1@@ B had 0.@@ 34 lit@@ res , and Me@@ te@@ or = 1@@ C had 0.@@ 62 lit@@ res .
the maximum altitude for all three models was 3@@ 7@@ km .
between 1965 and 1968 , the development of Me@@ te@@ or = 2 was under@@ way in the Aer@@ on@@ au@@ tics Institute , with its first launch tests in October 1970 .
the Me@@ te@@ or = 2 ro@@ cket had a launch weight of 3@@ 80 kg , and was capable of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60@@ km .
subsequently built models were the Me@@ te@@ or = 2@@ H and Me@@ te@@ or = 3 .
Poland 's admission to CO@@ SP@@ AR ( Committee for Space Research ) in 1960 should be mentioned , as well as the appointment of a national CO@@ SP@@ AR board two years later .
Poland also participated in the Inter@@ ko@@ smo@@ s space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satelli@@ tes , and in 1978 , the Polish pilot Mi@@ ro@@ s@@ law Her@@ mas@@ ze@@ wski became the second inter@@ cos@@ mon@@ aut after V@@ ladimir Rem@@ kov .
aboli@@ shing the legislation on public works is not the solution .
last week the Constitutional Court abolished the law on public works .
the resolution caused lively public debate .
it will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective .
liber@@ ally oriented financial systems in the EU , just as those in the glob@@ alised world , are based on the principle of an un@@ regulated economic competition .
its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves .
the cause is the principle of free trade and free , completely un@@ regulated movement of private capital together with un@@ controlled financial speculation .
due to significant labour cost differences ( sal@@ aries ) there is pressure on prices .
on this basis , it should be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by import@@ ing cheap goods , `` the rug is pul@@ led '' from under the competition 's prices to capture a greater market share and , in this way , increase its own profits .
on a wider scale , this means most businesses must move production abroad , import che@@ ap@@ ly from abroad , or close down . the result is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies .
since private capital is not bound by social responsibility , and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes , the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase .
the whole situation is bol@@ stered by the business@@ man 's complete un@@ willingness to pay taxes , which would allevi@@ ate the economical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit .
the situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statistical data .
the ru@@ th@@ less private capital practices create particular economic situations , where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition , aiming to arti@@ fi@@ cially lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment .
in other words , governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while dis@@ regarding the drop in social standards .
this occurs chie@@ fly in amendments to existing law .
the aim is to economically force the domestic population to accept prices dict@@ ated by private capital , especially in terms of sal@@ aries .
on one hand , this economic system of force , in case of long = term unemployment , on the other , restricted employee rights in the workplace .
this yiel@@ ds growing poverty and an increasing vo@@ id between the poor and the rich .
in Germany there are already a host of food hand = out centres for the poor , who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages .
the number of these people is already in the millions .
in the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy , it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a sal@@ ary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage .
just such a scandal was revealed in the case of au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary staff in the Bun@@ de@@ stag .
the austerity measures for all the southern EU states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation , where people are pres@@ su@@ red by a catastrop@@ hi@@ c drop in living standards to em@@ ig@@ rate as it was in the 19th century , or to e@@ ke out an existence on star@@ vation wages on the edge of society , in the hope that the country will eventually see some foreign investment .
at this point we have to ask where this may come from ?
if it is to come from other EU states , then poverty is being shi@@ fted from one country to another , or it will not come at all , because Chinese , Indian , Brazilian , Turkish , Mor@@ oc@@ can , Egyptian , and African labour is still at a fra@@ ction of European wages .
this applies to all of Latin America .
liberal theory and the Media inc@@ ess@@ antly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy , and that a controlled economy leads to economic ru@@ in .
private capital cru@@ el@@ ly insi@@ sts on the view@@ point that the State must not intervene in the economy .
ther@@ eu@@ p@@ on , we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence , or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country , for its own sel@@ fish ends .
here , the answer must be yes .
the proof is the existence of the almost om@@ ni@@ po@@ tent , and in all states , om@@ ni@@ present lobby .
the result is a desper@@ ate situation manifest@@ ing itself through corruption , through mutual benefits and legislation , where almost everything is criminal , but nothing is pun@@ is@@ hab@@ le .
in Germany the situation is such that state mini@@ stries , through lack of financial resources , contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms , who are basically connected with industry .
these laws are then approved in the Bun@@ de@@ stag .
real power does not come from the people as the Western = style constitu@@ tions claim , but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests .
it is clear that liber@@ ally = orient@@ ated democracies will now quickly reach a situation , as is described by App@@ ian in his work on the Roman Republic Cris@@ is in the time of Ces@@ ar and Pom@@ pe@@ i : " the State was already long in complete de@@ generation and its offices taken by force .
with bri@@ ber@@ y , illegal acquisition of benefits , and with stones or s@@ words .
bri@@ ber@@ y and corruption were ri@@ fe and un@@ hin@@ dered , and the people would vote for a result which had been bought `` ... '' people with principles did not run for office , so on one occasion the whole deb@@ ac@@ le meant the state went eight months without consu@@ ls .. `` .. '' There was actually talk about the only answer to this terrible situation being auto@@ cracy , and an energe@@ tic man should be elected . " App@@ ian had Pom@@ pe@@ i in mind , but it was Ces@@ ar who changed democracy for auto@@ cracy permanently .
the conclusion , just as in anti@@ qu@@ ity , the current society is built on un@@ sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous ten@@ dencies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole .
private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole .
the outcome is now , as it was then , an unprecedented dec@@ ad@@ ence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms .
the caus@@ ality of the rise of the fasc@@ ist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the mis@@ guided liberalisation of the economic system in the 19th and 20th centuries .
the current state of affairs , when we consider the dem@@ ise of those systems in favour of liber@@ alised democracy as an inter@@ lu@@ de , can expect its next cycle .
the particularly catastrop@@ hi@@ c reality is that the current elite is completely ignor@@ ing the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives , humanitarian and social disasters , which we are already witness@@ ing , as well as crimes against humanity , as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history .
the abolition of the law on public works is not the answer , at least not in the long term .
under the pressure of economic competition , internationally as well as within Europe , the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lower@@ ing the population 's living standards .
this pattern is thus system@@ ic .
to address this , there are targeted political and social reforms , which strengthen the state 's capital participation in the economy , increase the people 's influence over the state and weak@@ en the monopoly held by private capital over society in favour of the state .
Israel : chaos Lab .
`` No@@ thing comes from violence and nothing ever could , '' from St@@ ing 's Fra@@ gi@@ le , where one of the main ver@@ ses from the refra@@ in is `` L@@ est we forget how fragile we are . ''
`` If my sons did not want war , there would be none , '' said the dying Gut@@ le Schn@@ app@@ er , wife of Ma@@ yer Am@@ sch@@ el Roth@@ sch@@ ild in 18@@ 49 .
the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip , as always , has spark@@ ed a lot of reaction .
some stand by Israel , argu@@ ing it has the right to self = defence , and Palestinians are portra@@ yed as terrorists , while others support the Palestinians , claim@@ ing racism by the Israeli state , claim@@ ing that genocide is being committed against Palestinian Ara@@ bs , and that Israel is a terrorist state .
I do not want to d@@ well , in these repeated periodi@@ c waves of killing , on who is the trans@@ gres@@ s@@ or and who is the victim , after all , today 's inhabitants of Israel , including the self = governing territories , were born into the current political situation , and did not live through the start of the violence .
I would like to offer the readers a pe@@ ek behind the scenes , a look at whom , most of all , this 95 = year long tension is serving ( starting from Bal@@ four 's declaration in November 19@@ 17 ) on this small piece of land in the Middle East .
some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts , while others are derived from my own understanding of who , that is , which group of people is the main source of events in modern history .
human history is in the first instance about the struggle for power .
in every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napol@@ eon .
what is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people , who had chosen their path independently , or whether behind their thr@@ one stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre = calculated goal .
we must accept that we live in a time when the world 's wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals , and that this concentration of wealth and the power it ex@@ u@@ des could not happen in one generation 's li@@ fes@@ pan .
among these astronom@@ ically rich families , one stands out , which could be considered the pup@@ pet master ( whether someone else stands above them , I am un@@ sure , but I would not rule it out ) - the Roth@@ schil@@ ds .
not much is written about them .
understand@@ ably .
the first news agency ( Re@@ u@@ ters ) they bought in the 90 's of the 19th century , in order to prevent their name being connected with acts of high crimin@@ ality , which appeared in their background and which always meant securing power , increasing wealth , or both .
they hold majority stak@@ es in almost every central bank in the world , and against the countries , where they do not hold a stake , they are either w@@ aging or preparing for war ( before the ass@@ ault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries , after Iraq it was 5 , after the over@@ throw of K@@ ad@@ da@@ fi 4 remained , but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government ) .
who@@ ever attempted to de@@ fy this family died .
Ab@@ ra@@ ham Lin@@ col@@ n refused to rene@@ w the status of the central bank to the Roth@@ sch@@ ild Bank of America , and during the Civil War he began to issue his own ( that is state = issued ) money and was ass@@ assin@@ ated in 18@@ 65 at the theatre .
J@@ F@@ K began issuing his own money and wanted to close the Fed ( Federal Reserve ) , and was killed in 196@@ 3 , Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man Louis Mc@@ F@@ ad@@ den was po@@ ison@@ ed in 19@@ 36 , after he had intended to su@@ e the Fed for causing the Great Depression of 19@@ 29 .
their thir@@ st for global power led in the years of 18@@ 59 - 18@@ 71 to the form@@ ulation of a three = world = war plan by the fre@@ em@@ as@@ on leader of the 3@@ 3rd degree , Albert Pi@@ ke .
the first war was to remove the large mon@@ arch@@ ic state bodies in Europe , the second was to remove colonial rule , especially from Great Britain , and the third will reduce the world 's population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people ( this number of sla@@ ves will suff@@ ice for their comfort and luxury , and will not use up so many resources ) , the creation of one universal faith ( ec@@ umen@@ ism is just an ap@@ peti@@ ser for this solution ) , and finally the sei@@ zing of absolute power .
the method , which the group of weal@@ thy families with the Roth@@ schil@@ ds leading the way , employ is the in@@ sti@@ gation of crises , followed by the offering of a solution ( order ab cha@@ o - order from chaos ) .
these solutions are false , however , and always lead to a worse situation ( vi@@ de establishment of the Fed , so that the crisis of 19@@ 07 would not be repeated ) .
thus , having succeeded in ass@@ assin@@ ating Fer@@ din@@ and , the Hab@@ sburg hei@@ r to the Au@@ stro = Hungarian thr@@ one , in Sar@@ aje@@ vo thereby un@@ le@@ ash@@ ing World War I , they destroyed ts@@ ar@@ ist Russia with the Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ k revolution .
the First World War ended ab@@ rup@@ tly , milit@@ arily and economically un@@ substan@@ ti@@ ated , with German capit@@ ulation ( the war was no longer needed to destroy ts@@ ar@@ ist Russia ) and the central European powers of Austria = Hungary were subsequently disman@@ tled .
to facilitate the inc@@ eption of the Second World War , they allowed ban@@ kers and politicians to create a lat@@ ent conflict situation by s@@ add@@ ling Germany with huge war repar@@ ations , thereby making a ra@@ dic@@ alist example of the im@@ pover@@ ished m@@ asses , it remained only to introduce a sufficiently convincing cul@@ pri@@ t and a leader with a simple solution , while also creating a multi = ra@@ cial Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ akia with a strong German minority to play , and indeed did , the role of a fifth col@@ ony , once the war had been ign@@ ited .
at the end of the 19th Century , the Roth@@ schil@@ ds in@@ sti@@ gated the establishment of the Zi@@ on@@ ist movement , one branch of which stro@@ ve to form the Jewish State , seeking out an area of historic Ju@@ de@@ a , Jerusalem , to make its capital ( the Ret@@ ur@@ n to Z@@ ion ) .
the af@@ ore@@ mentioned Bal@@ four Declaration formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine , where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population .
terrorist attacks occurred on both sides .
world War II broke out , and whether Hitler broke free from the le@@ ash , which international ban@@ kers were holding him on , or whether his actions were all part of the plan , is difficult to determine , nevertheless the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundation to the world 's acceptance of the Jewish State .
Israel was officially formed in 1948 , and just as the war repar@@ ations for World War II were la@@ yed on Germany , the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war 's hot@@ bed .
provided the international ban@@ kers succeed , the Jewish Nation , as with the second , will be the victims on the front line , now together with the Ara@@ bic - or more generally , Muslim - population of the Middle East .
Israel is like a huge laboratory , a source of dis@@ cor@@ d and chaos not only within the country , but on an international level ( just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel ) .
who is the wrong = do@@ er and who is the victim in the Palestine = Israel conflict , where in@@ justice bre@@ eds in@@ justice in an endless cycle of violence , while everything began from the gre@@ ed of a few and their lust for global power ?
here , we must differenti@@ ate between Israel 's general population and their leaders , because , just as it happens here , the international ban@@ kers introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for .
Israel 's current prime minister , Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u ' the ha@@ w@@ k ' , is a typical example of a fasc@@ ist politi@@ cian , lo@@ yal to the international ban@@ kers , who does everything to in@@ sti@@ gate war with Iran , which would , due to its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan , ... ) lead to a greater threat of global conflict , and through its control of the Hor@@ mu@@ z Stra@@ it , where 20 % of the world 's oil must sail ( the channel is only 2 miles wide ) , to the destruction of the world 's economy .
in what light stand the words , spoken by David Rock@@ ef@@ eller in 1994 : `` All we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order . ''
the New World Order in their eyes is one of master and slave .
a world where the rest of the human population serve the luxury of a hand@@ ful of financial ari@@ sto@@ crats .
a world , where each new = born is im@@ plan@@ ted with a chip , which makes their existence completely sub@@ ju@@ gated .
" he also forced everyone , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on his right hand or on his fore@@ head , so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark , which is the name of the be@@ ast or the number of his name .
if anyone has insight , let him calculate the number of the be@@ ast ,
for it is man 's number . his number is six hundred and six@@ ty six . "
AR@@ GO : when things are at their worst - call Hollywood .
in November 1979 , a mo@@ b of Islamic student demonstr@@ ators took over the American em@@ bass@@ y in Teh@@ ran and held 52 diplom@@ ats ho@@ stage .
they were to be released in exchange for the over@@ thrown Sha@@ h Moh@@ am@@ mad Re@@ za P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi , who f@@ led after the revolution to the USA , which had actually supported his regime for several decades .
for the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Sha@@ h over@@ board , because this would seriously jeop@@ ardi@@ se the trust of other al@@ lied countries .
the release of the host@@ ages in Iran , where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the the@@ o@@ cratic regime , could not be achieved .
this was a blow to the pres@@ tige of the United States , which was later compo@@ und@@ ed by the fi@@ as@@ co of attempting to free the host@@ ages by force .
the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated diplom@@ ats were finally released after 4@@ 44 days , following negotiations medi@@ ated by the Alger@@ ian government .
their or@@ deal provo@@ ked a wave of solidarity and anti = Iranian feelings at home .
the deb@@ ac@@ le in Iran significantly influenced J@@ im@@ my Car@@ ter 's loss with Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan in the 1980 presidential elections .
the film Ar@@ go , directed by the actor Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck , re@@ counts one episode in this story , which brought America a small victory .
just before the em@@ bass@@ y was sei@@ zed , six employees escap@@ ed .
after some peri@@ pet@@ ei@@ a , they ended up in the Canadian amb@@ ass@@ ador 's residence .
the CIA , in collaboration with the Canadian authorities , succeeded in getting them out of Iran , helped by an ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant cover story - they left on Canadian pas@@ sports as members of a film crew , who were surve@@ ying locations for a sc@@ i = fi block@@ bu@@ ster .
a combination of gen@@ res
the plan , conceived by `` ex@@ fil@@ tration '' expert , Tony Men@@ dez , required the assistance of Hollywood .
for the story to be believed , the film project was reported on in specialist magazines , press conferences were organised , and the fic@@ ti@@ tious production company had a real office .
the details of the operation were , for a long time , kept secret ; the film draws on the memories of Tony Men@@ dez .
Aff@@ le@@ ck 's film is a pec@@ uli@@ ar mix of gen@@ res .
on one hand , there is a realistic inc@@ isi@@ ve political thri@@ ller , and at the same time a `` cap@@ er movie , '' with small vic@@ tories and double = crossing - another example would be Ocean 's Ele@@ ven .
the mood altern@@ ates in the film - on one side , sharp documentary = style sequ@@ ences in Teh@@ ran ( the title sequence shows i@@ con@@ ic photos from news of the time , relating to the same events portra@@ yed in the film - there are no big differences ) .
on the other hand , ligh@@ ter sections from Hollywood , lac@@ ed with ir@@ ony and a little exag@@ ger@@ ation .
then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies - men in suits debating the situation around meeting tables , in office corri@@ d@@ ors , over the phone ...
Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck has managed to re@@ start his career in extraordinary style .
the deri@@ ded actor has become a respected director , and his acting is no longer the target of ir@@ onic comments .
AR@@ GO is his third big = screen movie , following his dark crime movie G@@ one Baby G@@ one ( 2007 ) and the thri@@ ller The Town ( 2010 ) .
it is also Aff@@ le@@ ck 's first picture , which does not take place in the director 's hom@@ et@@ own of Bo@@ ston .
the atmosp@@ h@@ eric feel in different locations is one of the characteristics , which took his earlier films above Hollywood standards .
Aff@@ le@@ ck shows it in Ar@@ go , where Teh@@ ran is `` featured '' by Canada .
the best scenes of the film take place in the streets , in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the sie@@ ge on the em@@ bass@@ y is impres@@ sively lu@@ ci@@ d , creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise , which come floo@@ ding in , as history suddenly takes a turn .
a similar effect is achieved by Aff@@ le@@ ck and his team in the fic@@ ti@@ tious scenes ( the fa@@ ke staff at the Teh@@ ran ba@@ za@@ ar ) .
too much action in too many places
the director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many nail = bit@@ ing scenes for the film .
what little there is , is worked well , with some occasion@@ al em@@ bel@@ li@@ sh@@ ments to reality - these do not all come off so elegan@@ tly ( the scene , where a lo@@ oming crisis is aver@@ ted at Teh@@ ran airport by a phone call in America , followed by a ch@@ ase on the run@@ way seems quite far = fet@@ ched ) .
AR@@ GO 's weakness is its diver@@ gence , which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places .
Al@@ an Ar@@ kin and John Goo@@ d@@ man play their roles as the Hollywood assi@@ stants with great charm ; their characters deserve more room , and are not by far the only ones in this film .
Aff@@ le@@ ck 's film loses the dramatic pull a little , it is a film , which can be wat@@ ched with reasonable interest , its production and re@@ tro = style are e@@ voc@@ ative of thri@@ ll@@ ers from the 70 's .
it does not really cap@@ tiv@@ ate .
as a remin@@ der of history 's particular ways and a testim@@ ony to how exag@@ ger@@ ated the views are on the all = powerful all = controlling secret services , this will do .
rules for blo@@ wing up bal@@ lo@@ ons , for ban@@ anas and a cir@@ cus
the www.@@ ban@@ kov@@ ni@@ po@@ plat@@ k@@ y@@ .com server , which issues a pol@@ l every year on the most absurd bank charge , has now decided to announce a competition for `` the most absurd regulation or proposal from the EU . ''
`` We were promp@@ ted by the latest story , where the EU plans to take on a 40 percent quota of women at management level of Europe 's largest companies , '' Patri@@ k Nach@@ er , the pol@@ l 's organis@@ er , told Pra@@ vo .
among the latest nom@@ inated absur@@ di@@ ties , for instance , is the recent decision by the European Court to uni@@ fy insurance premi@@ ums for men and women .
until now , women were fav@@ oured in life insurance prices , because they constitute a lower risk for insur@@ ers .
" other un@@ belie@@ vable ideas from the EU can be nom@@ inated by anyone until the end of the year .
the actual voting will then take place until the end of February 2013 , " informed Nach@@ er .
among the controversial EU regulations , we might include the mandatory addition of bio = ingredients to fuel , which consequently har@@ ms the environment , the ban on reliable mer@@ cury ther@@ mom@@ e@@ ters just because they contain a relatively small quantity of a toxic substance , or the rules on the size of chi@@ cken c@@ ages , which significantly raised egg prices this year .
the ban on the use of the term `` sp@@ read@@ able but@@ ter '' and the withdrawal of classic light bul@@ bs from sale had previously come under criticism .
first rate ban@@ anas are to measure 14 cen@@ timet@@ res
the Union 's machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lob@@ b@@ ying group , whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by state or group of states ' interests ( just as the Czech Republic is promoting the demands of its banks under threat of being vet@@ o@@ ed ) .
the lobby 's interests were , for example , that ban@@ anas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 cm in the EU , and were not to display and `` an@@ om@@ al@@ ous cur@@ v@@ ature . ''
the European Commission defended itself , saying that it was only harmon@@ ising existing dis@@ join@@ ted national standards , which complicated trading .
nor@@ ms relating to fruit and vegetables have already been sof@@ tened by the EU despite opposition from certain states , referring to the food waste caused by the existing directives .
one possible prize = winner in the pol@@ l may be the last year 's EU regulation according to which inf@@ lat@@ able bal@@ lo@@ ons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not infl@@ ate them without par@@ ental supervision .
here , the EU pointed to an American research , which indicated that , among other toys , bal@@ lo@@ ons are one of the main causes of child suff@@ oc@@ ation .
a similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age using party blo@@ wers .
strange ideas are conceived at home too
fairly absurd is the rule relating to individual European officials - everyone in the EU , who holds an official post , may not use the term Macedonia due to it being a sensitive topic for Greece , and instead the ac@@ ron@@ ym F@@ Y@@ ROM ( For@@ mer Yugosla@@ v Republic of Macedonia ) should be used .
the Ban@@ kov@@ ni@@ po@@ plat@@ k@@ y@@ .com server in collaboration with the Liberal Econom@@ ist Association , La@@ isse@@ z F@@ aire , also nom@@ inated , aside from the af@@ ore@@ mentioned absur@@ di@@ ties , for example the Union 's regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state .
the EU stipul@@ ated the maximum volumes of food provisions , which may be present within the CR on the day of our entry to the Union .
the Czech Republic there@@ after exceeded , for instance , the permitted volume of mus@@ h@@ room pre@@ serves , which incurred a high penalty .
the pol@@ l 's organis@@ ers were also impressed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a coastline , or the suggestion of al@@ loc@@ ating funding for a request for funding .
these ideas did not come from Brussels , however , but from Prague .
" we are han@@ dic@@ apped because we do not have the sea .
we are asking the European Union for a refund , " declared the minister for agriculture , back in autumn 2004 , J@@ aro@@ sla@@ v Pal@@ as ( C@@ SS@@ D ) .
his argument was that there had been a good har@@ vest of cere@@ als , and due to the so = called buy = out interventions , the state 's ware@@ houses were full and were forced to export .
the Czech Republic is further away from a port , so according to Pal@@ as the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euros .
the European Commission finally met the CR hal@@ f@@ way by organising a tender for the purchase of cere@@ als from countries that do not have access to the sea .
funding to subsidi@@ se funding requests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Development 's minister , P@@ av@@ el N@@ em@@ ec ( US = D@@ EU ) , specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels .
EU : bizarre legislation is the exception
regulations may well become the target of criticism among member states , but the EU 's efforts at regulation , more effective operation , and development of the entire Union deserve recognition , according to a number of experts .
a more important issue , according to experts , is the drawing of EU funds on projects , which have hardly anything in common with strengthening the European integration , but which was pushed through by member states during a budget meeting .
emotions fl@@ are among Cze@@ chs when , just as other countries in the Union , the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular labelling on its traditional products , in which it does not always succeed .
the Cze@@ chs fought for six years with the Germans and Austri@@ ans to protect the labelling of their ol@@ om@@ ou@@ cke t@@ var@@ u@@ z@@ ky , however the tu@@ z@@ em@@ sky rum , whose tradition reaches back to the 19th century here , had to be ren@@ amed tu@@ z@@ em@@ ak by the manufacturers .
the app@@ ell@@ ation of rum can only be given to products di@@ still@@ ed from cane sugar , and not sugar be@@ et .
Carl@@ s@@ bad w@@ af@@ ers , Po@@ ho@@ reli@@ cky and Tre@@ bon@@ sky car@@ p , and Z@@ ate@@ c hops have been added to the official list of registered products of the EU , alongside the world = renowned f@@ eta cheese and g@@ org@@ on@@ z@@ ola , German mar@@ zip@@ an from Lu@@ beck , and Par@@ ma ham .
the EU 's stam@@ p of protection can also be pro@@ u@@ dly shown on Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce g@@ inger@@ bread and H@@ ori@@ cky tubes .
people want me to save the re@@ public , but I am an amate@@ ur , says Ok@@ am@@ ura
Sen@@ ator , how does a person decide they want to run for President ?
this is not about me being a sen@@ ator or president .
if everything in our country worked without problems , then I would not be running for any post .
I can not watch any longer the country having been rob@@ bed over the past twenty years , th@@ ie@@ ves ro@@ aming about there and people 's taxes and retirement age increasing .
I had no ambition to be a politi@@ cian .
when I see something I do not like , though , I try to find a solution to change things .
since I have already turned for@@ ty , and I am an independent non = party man , I have no other choice to influence things but to stand for sen@@ ator or president .
you have already reached the Sen@@ ate , but shortly after that you are taking off for the Castle .
are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this ?
I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the Castle based on the results in the Sen@@ ate 's elections .
later , I added that if I were elected as sen@@ ator , I would be standing for president .
my goal , though , is not the post , the post is a tool to allow my vision to be realised .
therefore , I need the greatest influence , and the strongest mandate possible .
the trouble is not just that as a nation we swe@@ ar in the pu@@ b or at the television , but that we tra@@ mp@@ le anyone , who wants to try to change things .
the Media add to this , misleading the public , and mistak@@ ing freedom of speech with freedom to lie .
for example , I was alle@@ ge@@ dly bri@@ bing re@@ por@@ ters , or I was alle@@ ge@@ dly an advis@@ or of J@@ ir@@ i Par@@ ou@@ be@@ k .
let 's talk about your vision .
you set out on your castle sie@@ ge with a thesis on the material and criminal responsibilities of politics , and a retro@@ active financial dis@@ closure of assets over twenty million .
you need to change the law for this .
as president , though , you do not have this power , and only the Sen@@ ate as a whole may propose laws .
how are you going to solve this ?
when I lob@@ bi@@ ed , as a citizen , for tour guide work to be a free trade , it was successfully carried through .
the problem is political squ@@ ab@@ b@@ ling - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right , it will be deliberately rejected , causing delays for the public .
as an independent non = party man , I stand a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides .
the advantage I hold is that without the political pi@@ ge@@ on@@ hol@@ ing or dog@@ mas I can take what is best for our country from any side , and apply it .
do you see yourself as a person from the right , or the left ?
from the Czech view@@ point , it seems they tend to put me to the left .
for me , it just does not matter if it is a little to the left or right .
the important part for me is moving forward .
it is not about whether someone is from the left or right , I just want to bring people together .
I always support any good public solutions , even if they are put forward by the K@@ SC@@ M or the O@@ DS , and , in the same way , I will oppose bad ideas .
you get an@@ gr@@ y when someone calls you a popu@@ list .
are you not confir@@ ming this with what you have stated ?
when you make a company business plan , you also have some ideal goal and vision .
you try to come close to it .
some may call it popu@@ li@@ sm , but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere , or they have been put forward by experts .
but without the support of the Parliament you will be left with just slo@@ gan@@ s .
you will not last long in politics with that .
or do you believe that if you walk among the public and talk with them , that you will succeed , say , in passing criminal and material responsibility ?
I have no alternative .
I need to convince politicians , re@@ por@@ ters , and the public , and try to get them on my side , so we can put this through .
if I were elected president , it would not be a problem to arrange a live television broadcast , where I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians , civil serv@@ ants , judges , and the Att@@ or@@ ney General .
and , as the case may be , they would need to explain why they did not want this .
when there is a strong figure to point out the issues , it just needs some pressure on the political scene .
take for instance the direct election of the president , it was achieved thanks to public pressure .
I will say frankly that I am an amate@@ ur , I am not a geni@@ us or an intellectual .
I am looking for allies to share my opinions and vision .
I have just started out in politics , and I am looking for a majority support for my agenda .
I will try to make things progress , but it if does not work out , in six years I will finish and return to the private sector .
it sounds a little like Ok@@ am@@ ura is trying to save the Czech Republic .
I am no sa@@ vi@@ our .
I know that alone I will not achieve anything , so I have asked acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces , whether they would run for the sen@@ ate .
I went to Radi@@ m Jan@@ cur@@ a , who dec@@ lined due to his work@@ load .
so I , at least , support investig@@ ative journalist , Jan@@ a Lor@@ en@@ co@@ va , who un@@ covered frau@@ dul@@ ent activity with light heating oil .
I put myself forward , because people are really dis@@ cont@@ ented , but now I have my doubts .
six@@ ty percent of people did not go to vote , and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment .
in the sen@@ ate , there are only two independ@@ ents , including me .
people have voted for a sen@@ ate that will make it difficult to enforce changes .
nonetheless , I will fight for my vision , for example , for the direct election of may@@ ors or regional council pre@@ sidents .
are you considering having your own party ?
I have not considered it yet , because I have neither the time to verify that every party member has a clean background , nor the money to do it .
I have no money even for a presidential campaign , my transparent account holds just 20 thousand .
you have no money ?
you are talking about financial dis@@ clo@@ sures , but what is yours like ?
I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million .
in Prague , I have land worth around 25 million , an apartment worth ten million , another apartment worth eight million , an art@@ work collection worth around ten million , an A@@ ston Martin worth 3.5 million , a S@@ ko@@ da Super@@ b worth a million , and I have a few million in my account .
I have the A@@ ston Martin , by the way , because it was my dream as a boy - I always liked James B@@ ond , who dro@@ ve the car , was gall@@ ant with women and also fought against evil and vil@@ la@@ iny .
you drive an A@@ ston Martin , have assets worth 60 million , but you have no money for a campaign ?
you say you want to change the Republic , but you are not keen on putting your own money into it .
this does not insp@@ ire much confidence .
I do not have 15 million for a campaign .
should I take out a loan ?
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign .
the fact that I do not have any spons@@ ors is evidence that there is no real interest in my programme .
I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign .
the expenditure on my campaign is basically covered by the pay I will be receiving as a sen@@ ator .
however , I would not be able to live on it , for instance , I could not pay for my son 's English school , which costs 30 thousand a month .
if I were only interested in making money , I would not be standing for election .
so you will still be in business so that you can make a living ?
did you not say you would be putting this on hold ?
this depends on the rate of pay .
as I promised , my activities have been partially reduced .
for example , my dep@@ uty is taking over as the CEO of the travel agency in spring .
people would like me to be a Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ an , who sa@@ ves the Republic .
but I must also live off something .
as a business@@ man , what would you usually make monthly ?
two hundred to 400 thousand , which I still do .
and if I became president , then I would end my business activity .
the full interview can be read in Saturday 's issue of Pra@@ vo .
the M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V architects prove that true advent@@ ures are not just in the head - drawing on the example of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse and the recently er@@ ected Bü@@ cher@@ berg ( literally `` book mountain '' ) - 2 photos
`` I think the building is fun , looks fut@@ ur@@ istic and ultimately provides something interesting to look at , '' said Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ ig , a pass@@ er = by at the road = side .
and Stefan Sper@@ mon , IT technici@@ an in a major firm based nearby comm@@ ented : `` It 's definitely a thing of beauty , the building . ''
however , I do wonder why people would need another library in this day and age .
everyone has the Internet , an iP@@ ad and e@@ Boo@@ ks .
no = one goes into one of these old = style libraries volun@@ t@@ arily nowadays , or am I wrong ?
Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse , a sle@@ ep@@ y town outside the gates of Rotterdam , which barely mer@@ its a visit , is a special record = holder .
the 80@@ ,000 = resident municipality has the lowest liter@@ acy rate in the whole of the Netherlands .
in order to counter@@ act this as@@ in@@ ine situation , the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to recre@@ ate the seven fic@@ ti@@ tious bridges that feature on the Euro notes as pretty , painted reinforced concrete mini@@ atures .
the success of the education offensive was limited .
and so the city fa@@ thers acknowledged that there was only one way to become master over the statistics : a library had to be built !
win@@ y Ma@@ as of the Rotterdam = based architectural firm M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V , master of au@@ d@@ ac@@ ious bar charts and producer of hum@@ or@@ ous and often c@@ yn@@ ical buildings , took the project on with his custom@@ ary compos@@ ure , and turned up at the competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a gr@@ in on his face .
and with the jud@@ ging panel still looking at him with be@@ wil@@ der@@ ment , shr@@ u@@ gging their shoul@@ ders , the imper@@ tin@@ ent Ma@@ as st@@ ack@@ ed his chosen pro@@ ps by order of size to form a py@@ ra@@ mid and round@@ ed off his presentation - now su@@ itably backed up with action - with the words : `` De@@ ar M@@ unicip@@ ality ! ''
so this is my suggestion for the Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse Book Mountain - for the so = called Bo@@ e@@ ken@@ berg !
nine years later , the 30 = million = euro mountain has been li@@ fted up .
it is part of a re@@ vit@@ alisation project , which also includes an underground car park , a super@@ market , a post office and a small number of adjacent apartment buildings and terra@@ ced houses , with a total of 50 d@@ well@@ ings .
at the beginning of November , the Bü@@ cher@@ berg was awarded second place in the `` Best Library of NL 2012 '' competition .
in addition , the project is also nom@@ inated for the Dutch National Wo@@ od Award 2012 .
thus , the fac@@ eless small = town ret@@ ort , that until now had nothing more to offer than a post = modern pedestrian area and a stun@@ n@@ ingly ug@@ ly town hall , behind whose white fac@@ ades one would expect to find a dairy plant , has been bol@@ stered by a piece of contemporary architecture .
first and foremost , however , Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse now has its first public cultural building in the history of its existence .
the long journey to the book
the first impression : the El@@ dor@@ ado of books bene@@ ath a cheese d@@ ome .
there is in fact a lift that climb@@ s through the centre of the mountain massi@@ f , however , the true jo@@ ys of space and literature are revealed when sc@@ aling the to@@ po@@ graphy on foot .
the interior space , gla@@ zed throughout , is bright and open , the fi@@ red clin@@ ker floors and the elegant street lamps speak the un@@ mistak@@ able language of a public town square .
the urban ambiance is perfect .
you are already on the lo@@ ok@@ out for a park ben@@ ch , a dog , and boys and girls playing football .
and everywhere there are books , books , books .
`` Nor@@ m@@ ally book shel@@ ves run along the fac@@ ade , and in the centre there is a large , dark space , which is usually un@@ pleasant and im@@ personal , '' says win@@ y Ma@@ as .
we turned the classical spati@@ al configuration on its head and turned the reading area inside out .
the interior of the Bü@@ cher@@ berg is cle@@ ver@@ ly used : in the centre there are offices , an Internet library , a ch@@ ess club , an environmental centre and the central technical support room .
one particularly special feature are the black book shel@@ ves , which simultaneously act as wall cla@@ dding , par@@ ap@@ ets and rail@@ ings for the sta@@ ir@@ way .
the appearance , feel and sc@@ ent are foreign .
even die = hard architects and construction engineers sha@@ ke their heads at the unknown construction materials .
`` H@@ ere we wanted to work with recy@@ cl@@ able materials , '' explained J@@ oo@@ p T@@ rou@@ bor@@ st , Project Manager for the M@@ unicip@@ ality of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse , on request of the Standard .
and thus one day we st@@ umb@@ led across a suitable waste product used in agriculture , on a Fris@@ ian farm .
for many years , milli@@ metre = thick artificial fabric has been used in green@@ houses and fields in the Netherlands as a base layer .
it is in@@ expensive and sa@@ ves time .
the thin textile la@@ sts for two seasons and is then dispo@@ sed of as bulk waste .
for the library , the fabric was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into four = cen@@ timet@@ re = thick boards .
under heat and pressure , the so = called Land@@ bou@@ w plastic ( KL@@ P ) changes colour to a dark , homo@@ gene@@ ous and robust material , that sm@@ ells like a mixture of new car smell and the smell of train@@ ers .
after 105 steps you have reached the summit .
at the end of the 500 = meter = long journey , you are rewar@@ ded in the Liter@@ ature Café , not only with a fantastic view of the city , but also with Dutch cro@@ qu@@ et@@ tes and pot@@ ted fic@@ us trees .
these provide atmosphere , but most importantly , regulate the air hum@@ i@@ dity in the liter@@ ary mountain range .
donations for the new soul
`` You would hardly believe it , but this building , in spite of the many glass panels , is a show@@ case project in the area of ec@@ ology , '' said T@@ rou@@ bor@@ st .
it is heated and cool@@ ed using geo@@ thermal heat .
although the Bü@@ cher@@ berg has a glass cover , the sun only sh@@ ines only briefly into the interior , even on sunny days .
the broad , lam@@ inated wood glu@@ e be@@ ams positioned at right = ang@@ les to the glass fac@@ ade , provide sha@@ de and absor@@ b the majority of the sun@@ light .
the indoor temperature is very pleasant .
the rest is taken care of by fully automatic ro@@ ller blin@@ ds .
Stefan Sper@@ mon , initially a scep@@ tic of the IT sector , has already vent@@ ured into the new library .
Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ ig has also visited already .
so too has T@@ C@@ M = teacher , C@@ yn@@ th@@ ia Bo@@ gar@@ de , who even refers to the Bo@@ e@@ ken@@ berg as Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse 's `` long over@@ due soul . ''
the reason : at the inau@@ gu@@ ration just a few weeks ago , every citizen was invited to don@@ ate a book from his / her personal collection .
this was , for the time being , to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully sto@@ cked library - currently there are 70@@ ,000 items .
the concept has been a success .
the shel@@ ves are full to capacity .
`` No@@ thing is worse than a half = empty library , '' said architect win@@ y Ma@@ as .
" I think that , thanks to our invitation , every resident now has a certain bond with this new building .
everyone knows that their book is part of the building .
even if it 's just for decoration .
as such , M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V have succeeded in ma@@ stering the master discipline that specialist jar@@ gon refers to as the formation of identity .
Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse has written liter@@ ary history .
however young and un@@ educated it may be .
this is ultimately a starting point for identity .
Sz@@ ab@@ o : `` Germans must play a greater role ''
in the vote on the incorpor@@ ation of Palestine , Germany abstained from voting .
according to Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o , Exper@@ t in US = European relations , in so doing Berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line .
Deutsche Welle : at the beginning of the week , Germany had initially sign@@ alled that it would vote against the Palestinians ' application for ob@@ server status within the United Nations .
however , Berlin subsequently abstained from voting .
why ?
Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o : Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza .
now , however , due to their special relationship with Israel , Germany must be cau@@ tious .
at the same time , however , I do not believe that it supports the American position either .
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - albeit without being too critical of Israel .
during the u@@ pr@@ ising in Libya in March 2011 , Germany likewise abstained from voting , when it came to establishing a no = fly zone .
this was ultimately implemented by NATO .
does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international affairs ?
yes , it does .
that is because it has just re@@ organised its foreign policy , indeed moving away from a policy that was , so to speak , managed by the USA , in favour of a German foreign policy .
this situation is ag@@ gra@@ vated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and standardis@@ ed policy .
the Germans thus find themselves caught between two fron@@ ts .
it is expected of them that they play a more independent role , yet this is something that they are not accu@@ stom@@ ed to .
I believe that they are still finding their way in this role , but they are en route to a `` more normal '' foreign policy .
a foreign policy similar to that of France , or Great Britain .
so what specifically does a `` normal '' foreign policy ent@@ ail , from a German perspective ?
it shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters , which are independent of those of the USA or European partners .
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy , that is , by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia , China or the Ne@@ ar East .
Germany 's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests .
have these economic interests had an influence on their attitude towards the Ne@@ ar East conflict and their voting in the UN ?
on the one hand , Germany has major revenue markets in the Ne@@ ar East , and particularly in the Gulf States .
therefore it must be careful not to aff@@ ront the public , but also the elite in the Ara@@ bic countries .
in any case , this plays a role .
however , I would n't want to as@@ cri@@ be too much weight to this . this is not an entirely one = sided relationship .
nonetheless , it does play an important role in Germany 's considerations .
has Germany damaged its relations with the USA , by absta@@ ining to vote on important decisions , such as the vote on Palestine ?
I think that in Europe , and even in the USA , a great understanding for the German position prev@@ ails .
therefore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fra@@ c@@ ture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya .
perhaps it will even earn Germany a certain degree of respect .
after all , it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered .
in Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative .
the USA , on the other hand , have spoken out clearly in favour of a ve@@ to .
are there differences of opinion between the USA and the many European nations ?
due to the American domestic policy , these differences have always existed .
I think that secre@@ tly , the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation .
however , due to the political situation here , the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly .
it is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appear .
if you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Net@@ an@@ jah@@ u , Obama is really not quite so enth@@ used by Net@@ an@@ jah@@ u 's policies .
does Germany find it difficult to re@@ conci@@ le its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand , and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other ?
I think that this is precisely what makes things so difficult for the Germans .
it would of course be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and standardis@@ ed European policy , which is currently not the case .
thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position .
this is precisely what they are doing with the Euro .
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in ur@@ ging Europe towards a standardis@@ ed European position .
this is , of course , no simple task for Germany , on account of its relations with Israel .
this has always been a sensitive subject .
yet I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role .
does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role ?
or does Germany still find leadership roles difficult ?
Germany is still not used to it , the country continues to be un@@ comfortable and , for obvious reasons , still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role .
if we look at the Euro crisis for example , every time that Germany assumes a more prominent role , various anti = German feelings become apparent .
this does not make matters simple for the Germans .
this is actually the same old problem : one does not want to be surrounded by hosti@@ le countries .
from this stance , Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA .
it must be recep@@ tive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions , and this is not easy .
the influence of the USA over European politics is continually dimin@@ ishing , yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacuum , so who is filling the gap ?
the Germans will simply have to play a greater role .
even if they do not like it , even if it is un@@ comfortable and makes them even more un@@ popular - c ' est la vie !
Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o is associ@@ ate director of the Tran@@ satlan@@ tic Academy in Washington , an institute in which ac@@ adem@@ ics and political experts from Europe and North America come together to research the challenges of the transatlantic community .

`` Brand protection '' in China : when Pum@@ a and Ar@@ man@@ i suddenly become Chinese
Ar@@ man@@ i is a world = famous brand , Polo R@@ al@@ ph Lau@@ ren likewise .
however , what is Ar@@ man@@ i Polo ?
behind this name hi@@ des a fully officially registered brand in China , however , one that has nothing whatsoever to do with the original companies .
nonetheless , it is enjoying protection , provided the actual cre@@ ators of the names do not su@@ e .
and even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights .
`` It is becoming increasingly more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China , '' said Thomas P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch , lawyer within the Ta@@ yl@@ or W@@ essing law firm , who speciali@@ ses in copyright infringement in the F@@ ar East .
every week a new case lands on my desk .
all the copy@@ c@@ ats require are a few additional letters in order that they can register their brands .
thus Gu@@ cc@@ i simply becomes L@@ u = Gu@@ cc@@ i , Pra@@ da = K@@ ny is registered in place of Pra@@ da .
German companies are also ' legally ' copied in this manner , such as manufacturer of sporting app@@ arel , Pum@@ a .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch opens a file containing regi@@ strations with the trademark office in Peking .
on 14 September 2010 a Chinese company copy@@ righ@@ ted the brand name Z@@ eg@@ na DF Pum@@ a there , an ali@@ as that also helps itself to the name of fashion re@@ ta@@ iler Er@@ men@@ eg@@ il@@ do Z@@ eg@@ na .
the fact that the Chinese are world champ@@ ions in copying and inf@@ ring@@ ing on intellectual property is well = known .
in the major cities there are multi = level department stores that sell counterf@@ eit goods almost exclusively .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch 's cases , however , are slightly different : on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the trademark office , fully officially , which is already protected elsewhere .
the Chinese call this `` B@@ ang M@@ ing@@ pa@@ i , '' a passenger brand .
the word is based on `` B@@ ang D@@ aku@@ an . ''
this refers to women who lat@@ ch onto rich men .
the Chinese authorities are un@@ aware of any w@@ ron@@ g@@ doing .
`` This har@@ ms business and we must fight against it , '' challenges P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch .
`` The brand is water@@ ed down , its uniqu@@ eness dis@@ appears - the image damage is enormous . ''
the financial losses and process costs of the affected branches amount into the millions , especially in the case of expensive flag@@ ship products .
according to information from market research company CL@@ SA , with a volume of 15 billion euros annually , China is the third largest market for luxury items , and the fastest growing .
however , the dele@@ tion of du@@ bi@@ ous entries in the trademark regi@@ stry are difficult to achieve , and cost a pretty pen@@ ny .
the process can last for up to nine years , with an uncertain outcome .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch reports of instances whereby the court dis@@ mis@@ ses cases , because after a long period of time , the name to which the objec@@ tion is being raised has become a `` market reality . ''
if the compla@@ in@@ ant is un@@ lucky , he may even have to pay the pla@@ gi@@ ar@@ ist money for having inf@@ ring@@ ed on his trademark in China , said P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch .
sometimes the law of the jung@@ le prev@@ ails here .
famous cases also relate to graphic elements .
in 2009 , D@@ aim@@ ler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer S@@ any , the company that recently acquired German concrete pump manufacturer P@@ utz@@ meister .
even today , the Chinese company is therefore permitted to use an em@@ ble@@ m that re@@ sembles the Mercedes star .
Vol@@ vo = purchaser Ge@@ ely originally used a blue and white logo that re@@ semb@@ led the BMW logo ; the dispute was arbit@@ rated and Ge@@ ely was forced to change it .
fashion house Lac@@ o@@ ste lost a suit in China against copy@@ c@@ ats from Hong Kong and Singapore , who were using the famous cro@@ codi@@ le looking in the other direction .
the Chinese authorities are un@@ aware of any w@@ ron@@ g@@ doing .
the CT@@ M@@ O trademark office in Peking does acknowledge that there were bott@@ len@@ e@@ cks in 2010 due to limited staff@@ ing and equipment .
in the past year , however , things re@@ porte@@ dly `` returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow . ''
thus the stock of un@@ processed appeal proceedings was reduced by 22 percent .
almost 5@@ 7@@ ,000 such c@@ ased were closed , 75 percent more than in the previous year .
nonetheless , there are still 8@@ 1,@@ 500 appe@@ als waiting to be resolved in the office .
to remedy this is very expensive
as is so often the case in China , the figures are imposing .
in the past year , more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were submitted to the CT@@ M@@ O , almost one third more than in 2010 .
this is a record and means that China , for the tent@@ h time in succ@@ ession , is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications , informed the authority .
the same applies for the inventory of valid trademarks , tot@@ alling 5.@@ 5 million in number .
in 2011 , 1.@@ 8 billion y@@ u@@ an in fees were received .
put simply , this means that each application costs on average 1,@@ 2@@ 80 y@@ u@@ an , or 160 euros .
to appeal against an application costs many times this amount , as can be seen in the case of the German family business , Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg .
for more than seven years , the group has been con@@ testing against a Chinese pla@@ gi@@ ar@@ ist .
the Germans did in fact manage to ex@@ pose the company 's illegal manufacturing of copied motor vehicle parts .
however , the copy@@ cat still secured the Chinese rights to the Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg brand .
this is something we missed ourselves , as family names can not be protected in Germany , said Han@@ no W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler , Chairman of the Board of Management at Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg Chem@@ ical Speci@@ alities in Munich .
the CT@@ M@@ O trademark office then also dis@@ missed the Munich = based company 's appeal .
in the next two instances , Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg was proven right , however the oppos@@ ing party continues to contest the matter to this day .
you have to pay extremely careful attention .
the matter is now pending before the Su@@ preme Court .
W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler is confident that the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion and pra@@ ises the professionalism of the courts .
however , he also says : `` The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time , money and ner@@ ves . ''
the internal costs can barely be calculated , the company archive even had to look through century = old records in order to provide proof .
five years ago Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg un@@ successfully offered the oppos@@ ing party a `` high six = figure sum in euros '' as settlement .
`` This shows how much this is worth to us , '' says W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
the dangers in the F@@ ar East even threaten to sp@@ il@@ ling over , back into Europe .
particularly if im@@ it@@ ators secure un@@ protected brand names there .
for example , a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg label for shoes and leather in Germany .
this is a business sector that the group had long vac@@ ated , yet nonetheless managed to prevent the registration .
`` You have to pay extremely careful attention , '' says W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
both he and P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch advise companies to be very careful when conducting business with China .
it is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights , rather foreigners should also register `` everything '' that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well , " said W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
otherwise costs can be much more expensive than the registration fee .
in actual fact : if Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg were to loo@@ se at the final hur@@ dle of its trademark dra@@ ma , they would probably have to pay the oppos@@ ing party license fees for the use of their own name , explained W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
or alternatively we would be forced out of the market in the respective sector .
world AIDS day : stom@@ p , sing , help
in Heidelberg , the im@@ b@@ ong@@ i cho@@ ir is re@@ hear@@ sing - and in the S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and , AIDS or@@ ph@@ ans are delighted .
the history of a link that over@@ comes far more than a distance of 8,@@ 7@@ 33 kilometres .
first of all , the st@@ amp@@ ing : co@@ w@@ boy boo@@ ts , bas@@ ketball shoes , ladies ' pumps and men 's lo@@ af@@ ers attempt to find the beat on the par@@ quet floor , and quickly do just that .
one = two = three = four .
only then do the voices of the sin@@ gers slowly s@@ well - alto , bass , ten@@ or and s@@ op@@ ran@@ o sur@@ ge , be@@ gui@@ le and ha@@ unt .
and F@@ iete H@@ op@@ f , the 29 = year = old conductor , almost rises up out of his shoes as he brings the en@@ semble together with his smooth , yet wild gest@@ ures .
it is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psych@@ ology in Heidelberg the im@@ b@@ ong@@ i Cho@@ ir are practi@@ sing a new song .
the fifteen sin@@ gers , aging from 23 to 69 years old , range from human gene@@ tici@@ sts to the maintenance man .
`` O@@ m ' O@@ ban@@ i '' is by no means a simple piece , with each voice having a different text , and in an extremely foreign language at that : Zul@@ u , which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa , Bo@@ ts@@ wan@@ a , Les@@ o@@ th@@ o , Mal@@ aw@@ i , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and in parts of S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and .
helping others to help themselves
there are around 34 million people infected with HIV around the world , as according to the estim@@ ations of UN@@ AIDS , the United Nations ' programme to battle AIDS .
of these , 2@@ 3.5 million live in South Africa .
in S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and , there are 24@@ 5@@ ,000 AIDS or@@ ph@@ ans .
meanwhile , more than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive .
the Vo@@ ices for Africa Association has found spons@@ ors in Germany for 180 AIDS or@@ ph@@ ans in the village of E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i .
70 of these attend a secondary school .
for 15 or 20 euros per month , you can become a spons@@ or .
this guarantees the child money for school , a school uniform and a warm meal each day in the Go@@ go Centre .
in Zul@@ u , im@@ b@@ ong@@ i means stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller or wor@@ shi@@ pper .
in this region , no = one can speak the B@@ ant@@ u language flu@@ ently , but they can sing it .
for almost ten years the cho@@ ir has been practi@@ sing songs in this foreign , ' soft ' language , and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from : the South of Africa .
for an 8,@@ 7@@ 33 = kilomet@@ re flight away from Heidelberg , in the north west of the S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and Kingdom , lies the village of E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , which reli@@ es on the vocal power of the German cho@@ ir .
for@@ ty percent are infected .
around 2@@ ,000 people live there , some still in simple mu@@ d and stra@@ w hu@@ ts , and the majority of them are children .
more than 300 of them no longer have parents , as they succ@@ um@@ bed to the HIV virus .
in E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i you get a small fo@@ res@@ ha@@ dow of the illness from which all of S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and is suffering : according to Un@@ ic@@ ef , the region has the highest HIV infection rates and the lowest life expec@@ tan@@ cy in the world .
circum@@ c@@ ision , which has been proven to reduce the risk of contrac@@ ting the virus by half , is barely practi@@ sed by the population .
more than for@@ ty percent of people in the S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and carry the imm@@ un@@ o@@ defici@@ ency virus , and dying in you mid = thir@@ ties is by no means rare .
on a group trip to Africa in early 2005 , the Cho@@ ir visited the village , but first and foremost , the I@@ mb@@ ong@@ is saw many children on the streets , lacking not only in par@@ ental care but in practically everything else as well : food , clothing , education .
without a school leaving certificate , there are barely any opportunities , particularly in a poor country .
initially it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school and enable him / her to have one warm meal a day for a few euros per year .
however , just one year later , the cho@@ ir established the `` Vo@@ ices for Africa '' Association , which since then has been looking after the AIDS or@@ ph@@ ans in E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i at an almost professional level .
facts on sex@@ ually transmitted infec@@ tions .
what are the most important sex@@ ually transmitted diseases ?
bacter@@ ial ST@@ IS include s@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia and gon@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ ea .
common vi@@ ral ST@@ IS are HIV , human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses , her@@ pes gen@@ itali@@ s and h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis .
cra@@ bs and sc@@ ab@@ ies belong among the par@@ asi@@ tic ST@@ IS .
who are the main affected groups ?
s@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis and gon@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ ea occur primarily in men that have inter@@ course with other men .
the Robert Ko@@ ch Institute understands that at least four in five of all s@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by means of sexual contact between men .
among hetero@@ sexual adults , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia infec@@ tions , tri@@ ch@@ om@@ oni@@ asis , candi@@ di@@ asis ( f@@ ung@@ al ) , gon@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ ea and human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses are frequently occurring sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
the spread of HIV among hetero@@ sexual adults in this country is relatively low ; however , around 20 percent of newly contrac@@ ted cases of HIV are found in this group .
among young people , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia infec@@ tions are much more common than in other population groups .
according to European surveys , three quarters of all infec@@ tions affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25 .
in this country , human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses are also frequently found in young people .
how has the number of infec@@ tions developed ?
not all sex@@ ually transmitted diseases are noti@@ fiable .
according to the Robert Ko@@ ch Institute , the number of s@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis infec@@ tions has more than doub@@ led from 1,@@ 6@@ 97 cases in 2001 , to 3,@@ 6@@ 98 cases in 2011 .
the number of newly contrac@@ ted cases of HIV has been on the decline since 2007 .
in 2011 there were around 2,@@ 700 cases .
this is around one tent@@ h fewer than the previous year .
which symptoms indicate a sex@@ ually transmitted disease ?
the infec@@ tious diseases can cause ul@@ c@@ ers in the gen@@ ital area , dis@@ comfort when ur@@ in@@ ating , discharge , lower ab@@ domin@@ al pain and bli@@ sters or war@@ ts .
however , often they cause no pain or any other symptoms , thus remaining un@@ detected .
how can you protect yourself ?
con@@ d@@ oms can reduce the risk of contra@@ ction , however , they do not offer 100 % protection .
this is because occasionally , the pa@@ tho@@ gens of sex@@ ually transmitted diseases can also be passed on via sme@@ ar infec@@ tions and close bo@@ di@@ ly contact .
therefore , first and foremost experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners under@@ go regular exam@@ inations .
if diagno@@ sed early , the majority of ST@@ IS can be cu@@ red and long = term consequences avoided .
through spon@@ sor@@ ships donations and by no means least the funds that the cho@@ ir raises across the whole of Germany , the money all adds up .
`` In total , we have already sent around 200@@ ,000 euros to E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , '' said An@@ nette L@@ enn@@ art@@ z , Chair@@ person of the association .
in the village itself , Z@@ od@@ wa D@@ lam@@ ini , a self = assured and asser@@ tive woman , manages the money from Germany .
she makes sure that the or@@ ph@@ ans have good accommodation , for example with one of their grand@@ mothers .
the go@@ gos , as the old ladies are called in Zul@@ u , are the pillars of the village .
some of them have up to 14 or@@ ph@@ ans living with them , providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes pun@@ ctu@@ ally every day , in their school uni@@ forms .
anyone who does n't have anyone left , arri@@ ves at the shel@@ ter with Kh@@ any@@ isi@@ le , a single woman who ear@@ ns the same sal@@ ary from the association as the two co@@ o@@ ks who co@@ ok for more than 200 hung@@ ry children every day .
in addition , `` Vo@@ ices for Africa '' has established a se@@ wing school , built two chi@@ cken co@@ ops and , together with the American health organisation , P@@ SI , organised for many in the village to be tested for HIV .
this is nothing to be taken for granted , as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country , the best way of keeping things under wra@@ ps is if people are dead .
a king with 14 wi@@ ves
`` AIDS is an absolute t@@ abo@@ o subject , '' said An@@ nette L@@ enn@@ art@@ z , `` because it is associated with sexu@@ ality . ''
this is actually strange for a country in which the king officially has 14 wi@@ ves .
the last absolute mon@@ arch of sub = Sah@@ aran Africa , King M@@ s@@ wat@@ i III . , is known for his excessive lifestyle .
poly@@ gam@@ y in place of democracy .
among other factors , the fact that the HIV virus has spread quickly over the past number of decades can also be attri@@ buted to this officially sanc@@ tioned lifestyle .
another factor is the large number of m@@ igrant workers who carry the virus across the country .
there are free con@@ d@@ oms on every corner , said An@@ nette L@@ enn@@ art@@ z , " but they are hardly used .
the culture prescri@@ bes otherwise - fl@@ es@@ h to fl@@ es@@ h . "
in order to promote the cultural exchange , the im@@ b@@ ong@@ i cho@@ ir tra@@ vels through Southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs of mel@@ anch@@ ol@@ y , fighting spirit , confidence and black self = est@@ e@@ em , which many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apar@@ thei@@ d .
a bus full of white people , who sing songs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only mor@@ ale and joy , but some gri@@ m = faced border soldiers even shed a few te@@ ars .
the journey always leads to E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , where the sin@@ gers visit their spons@@ or children .
even though you can barely find the small village on a map , it is more than well = known in the valley of the E@@ zu@@ l@@ wen@@ i River .
`` Go to E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , that 's where the light is , '' say the people there .
and if you make the 8,@@ 7@@ 33 = kilomet@@ re flight back to Heidelberg , to visit the stom@@ ping sin@@ gers in their re@@ hear@@ sal room , you 'll see that the light is there too .
Messenger : N@@ ASA dis@@ covers ice on Mer@@ cury
the Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on the planet Mer@@ cury .
it is thought that the ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick .
the US space agency , N@@ ASA , has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mer@@ cury .
although the planet lies closest to the sun , it does have frozen water - as shown in three studies published on Thursday in specialist magazine `` Science . ''
the Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that lies permanently in shadow .
this is thought to be at east 30 cen@@ timet@@ res and perhaps up to 20 metres thick .
the water pre@@ sum@@ ably came from com@@ ets or perhaps also ast@@ ero@@ ids that imp@@ acted with Mer@@ cury .
however , no = one is linking the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet , said Chief Scienti@@ st for the Messenger probe , S@@ ean Sol@@ om@@ on .
the temperature on Mer@@ cury can reach up to 4@@ 26 degrees Cel@@ si@@ us .
that said , the findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life reached other regions of the solar system .
unknown to the majority of the Earth 's inhabitants , there are prob@@ es , tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es and small robots such as the Pho@@ enix , deployed to research the dep@@ ths of the universe .
from time to time , they trans@@ mit images to Earth : small pe@@ ep@@ holes into the infin@@ ite expan@@ se .
this image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Plan@@ ck Institute .
the eight plan@@ ets of our solar system , plus the d@@ war@@ f planet Cer@@ es .
like Plu@@ to , which or@@ bits around the sun behind Nep@@ tune , Cer@@ es is not a planet according to the new definition of the term issued by the International A@@ stronom@@ ical Union in 2006 .
this image section from an infra@@ red recording by the Spitz@@ er tel@@ es@@ cope shows a `` family portra@@ it '' of countless generations of stars : the oldest stars are seen as blue do@@ ts , while more difficult to identify are the p@@ ink = coloured `` new = bor@@ ns '' in the star delivery room .
this star = forming region - rather un@@ roman@@ tically named W@@ 5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitz@@ er tel@@ es@@ cope in the C@@ assi@@ op@@ ei@@ a con@@ stell@@ ation , at a distance of 6,@@ 500 light years away .
this shi@@ m@@ mer@@ ing g@@ low of a dying star was captured by N@@ ASA 's Spitz@@ er tel@@ es@@ cope .
the don@@ ut = shaped ring consists of material , e@@ jec@@ ted by the star in the process of dying .
in the huge Tri@@ fi@@ d N@@ eb@@ ula , 5,@@ 400 light years away from the Earth , new stars are created from gas and dust .
N@@ ASA 's Spitz@@ er tel@@ es@@ cope shot this photo of the gal@@ ac@@ tic delivery room .
the P@@ lei@@ ades star cluster , also referred to as `` The S@@ even S@@ ist@@ ers , '' can be seen with the bare eye at night .
with the tel@@ es@@ cope , however , the colours really come into their own .
in this infra@@ red photo , the He@@ li@@ x N@@ eb@@ ula looks back at the ob@@ server like a red eye .
it is located 700 light years away in the Aqu@@ ari@@ us con@@ stell@@ ation .
its simil@@ arity with the continent resulted in this N@@ eb@@ ula acqu@@ iring the title ' North America ' .
a combination of normal and infra@@ red photography produced the spectacular colour@@ ing .
this baby star could only be captured in its full beauty using the Spitz@@ er tel@@ es@@ cope 's infra@@ red dete@@ c@@ tors .
Satur@@ n and its rings : how these occurred is the greatest pu@@ zzle in the field of astronom@@ y .
perhaps they are the rem@@ n@@ ants of a moon of Satur@@ n , which disappeared without a trace 4.@@ 5 billion years ago .
one of the largest and shar@@ p@@ est pictures from the Hub@@ ble tel@@ es@@ cope : the Whirlpool Galax@@ y
depending on the colour@@ ing , photographs of spi@@ ral galax@@ ies can become genuine works of art .
the photogra@@ ph published by the European Southern Ob@@ servatory shows the Tri@@ fi@@ d N@@ eb@@ ula in the S@@ ag@@ it@@ tari@@ us con@@ stell@@ ation , several thousand light years away .
the name Tri@@ fi@@ d st@@ ems from the Latin word tri@@ fi@@ dus ( divided into three parts ) , as dark stri@@ pes of dust divide the core of the birth@@ place of stars into three parts .
in the Op@@ hi@@ u@@ ch@@ us con@@ stell@@ ation , astronom@@ ers have photograph@@ ed the signs of a cos@@ mic col@@ li@@ sion : 400 million light years from the earth , the co@@ res of two mer@@ ging galax@@ ies move rapidly towards one another , dest@@ ined to col@@ li@@ de .
this star birth was captured by the Hub@@ ble tel@@ es@@ cope in the M@@ 83 spi@@ ral galax@@ y .
anyone who does n't like technical ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations may prefer to call it by its nick@@ name , the Southern Ca@@ ther@@ ine W@@ he@@ el .
the photo taken by the Hub@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cope shows a section of the Ir@@ is N@@ eb@@ ula in the C@@ ep@@ he@@ us con@@ stell@@ ation .
the ne@@ bul@@ a , 1,@@ 400 light years away , consists of partic@@ les of dust that are ten to one hundred times smaller than standard house dust .
this image was put together from the X = ray images captured by various tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es .
it shows a ring of black holes , 4@@ 30 million light years away from the Earth .
this group of galax@@ ies , named Ar@@ p 27@@ 3 , was pic@@ tured for N@@ ASA by the Hub@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cope .
scientists call the larger spi@@ ral galax@@ y U@@ G@@ C 18@@ 10 .
this star ne@@ bul@@ a is home to the brigh@@ test group of young stars in our Mil@@ ky W@@ ay .
this ' star cra@@ dle ' continually produces new young@@ sters .
likewise , this star clou@@ d , connected to the Ro@@ se@@ tte N@@ eb@@ ula , continually produces new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the Earth .
in this bright sh@@ ining galax@@ y with one small black hole , there exists no dust - only gas .
researchers pre@@ su@@ me that it only came into being shortly after the Big B@@ ang , when the universe was comp@@ ris@@ ed primarily of hydro@@ gen .
our view of the universe : the most important tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es
the tel@@ es@@ cope is thought to have been inv@@ ented in 16@@ 08 by Hans Li@@ p@@ per@@ h@@ ey - even before Galileo Galile@@ i used the device to observe the stars one year later .
since then , the mir@@ rors in optical tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es have become increasingly large and the insi@@ ghts that they provide increasingly profound .
for a period of 30 years , namely from 19@@ 47 until 1975 , the H@@ ale tel@@ es@@ cope in the Pal@@ om@@ ar Ob@@ servatory near San Die@@ go was the largest tel@@ es@@ cope in the world .
the mirror , shown in the image , had a diameter of five metres .
Ari@@ zona , USA , is home to the Lar@@ ge B@@ ino@@ cular Tel@@ es@@ cope .
it enables views of space via two mir@@ rors , each with a diameter of 8.@@ 4 metres .
the inner work@@ ings of the Gran tel@@ es@@ cop@@ io Can@@ ari@@ as on the Can@@ arian island of La Palma are huge - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.@@ 4 metres .
the mirror of the Southern African Lar@@ ge Tel@@ es@@ cope in South Africa is seg@@ mented - to reduce costs .
in spite of this it achie@@ ves a diameter of around eleven metres .
the disadvantage of this in@@ expensive construction method : the tel@@ es@@ cope is secu@@ rely cl@@ amp@@ ed at its angle of inc@@ lin@@ ation and its movement is therefore limited .
the Hob@@ by E@@ ber@@ ly tel@@ es@@ cope in Texas also has a fixed angle of inc@@ lin@@ ation .
what sets it apart : the high light = gathering capacity .
this - in spite of its compar@@ atively low mirror diameter - even matches that of the world 's largest refle@@ c@@ tor tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es .
with the help of a radio tel@@ es@@ cope in A@@ reci@@ bo ( Puerto R@@ ico ) researchers can listen for ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al signals in space .
the radio tel@@ es@@ cope has a diameter of 30@@ 5 metres .

view of the European Southern Ob@@ servatory ( ES@@ O ) in the Chi@@ lean An@@ des .
this is home to the Ver@@ y Lar@@ ge Tel@@ es@@ cope , which lives up to its name .
with its total of four mir@@ rors , the tel@@ es@@ cope can also focus on the medi@@ al infra@@ red spectrum .
likewise to be located at the ES@@ O Ob@@ servatory in Chile , the European Extre@@ m@@ ely Lar@@ ge Tel@@ es@@ cope is also being planned .
its main mirror is to span a full 42 metres and will be made from almost 1,000 mirror elements .
however , images are not to be expected until 20@@ 18 at the earliest .
until 2007 , the two K@@ eck tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es at the Ha@@ wai@@ ian volcan@@ o , Ma@@ una Ke@@ a , were the largest in the world .
they each have two mir@@ rors , each with a diameter of ten meters .
the K@@ eck tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es are part of the Ma@@ una Ke@@ a Ob@@ servatory , which alongside the K@@ eck tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , can look to the heav@@ ens with the help of the Su@@ bar@@ u tel@@ es@@ cope and the IR@@ TT@@ F .
another huge new tel@@ es@@ cope is also to be built on the Ma@@ una Ke@@ a , with a mirror diameter of thirty metres .
here you can mar@@ vel at an artist 's impression .
however , the most important insi@@ ghts into space are provided by the Hub@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cope .
since 24 April 1990 it has been sup@@ plying images of distant worlds .
since March 2009 the Ke@@ pler space tel@@ es@@ cope has been searching for extra = solar plan@@ ets , especially for any that may be inhab@@ itable .
on 2 February 2011 it was announced by N@@ ASA that 1,@@ 2@@ 35 plan@@ etary candidates had been identified since the mission began .
the image documents the final launch preparations on the Ke@@ pler space tel@@ es@@ cope .
the James Web@@ b Space Tel@@ es@@ cope ( J@@ W@@ ST ) will be launched into space on board an Ari@@ ane@@ 5 ro@@ cket by 20@@ 18 at the earliest .
the primary mirror of the infra@@ red space tel@@ es@@ cope has a diameter of 6.@@ 5 metres .
one of the tel@@ es@@ cope 's tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galax@@ ies that emerged after the Big B@@ ang .
scientists are assuming that ice also exists at Mer@@ cury 's south p@@ ole .
however , there is no reliable data in support of this as the Messenger or@@ bits around the plan@@ ets much closer to the north p@@ ole .
for decades , ra@@ dar measurements have indicated that there is ice on Mer@@ cury .
thanks to the Messenger probe that was launched in 2004 , the first to or@@ bit Mer@@ cury , scientists can now be certain .

a hun@@ t for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still compar@@ atively young .
the journey through the T@@ aly@@ sh Mountains can be described as wild and romantic .
the mini@@ bus ru@@ mb@@ les over the win@@ ding streets , past den@@ sely woo@@ ded hills , ra@@ ging rivers and simple farm@@ houses .
everywhere is green and lush - you could be for@@ given for thinking you were in the Black Forest .
however , this is the deep south of Azer@@ bai@@ jan , and the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away .
this is the home of the Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an people group , the T@@ aly@@ sh , of whom not much is known except that they speak perfect Per@@ sian and Azer@@ i and live long lives .
the final stop is L@@ eri@@ k .
the small town is bur@@ sting with over@@ power@@ ing architecture from Soviet times , which does n't fit with the picturesque mountain landscape at all .
tourists from Europe rarely come here ; the journey from Azer@@ bai@@ jan 's capital city , Bak@@ u , is too ar@@ du@@ ous .
it takes eight hours to travel the 3@@ 23 kilometres , as too much of the route is just a single track .
the fabulous wealth , for which the country has its oil in the Cas@@ pi@@ an Sea to thank , has not yet arri@@ ves here in the province .
yet Pil@@ ata Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva ( 48 ) is convinced that L@@ eri@@ k has what it takes to be a tourist attraction .
`` Bak@@ u became famous in May due to the Euro@@ vision Song Con@@ test , and next year we are having a festival to celebrate the oldest people in the world , '' said Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva .
she is the Director of the Museum of Lon@@ ge@@ vity , most likely the only of its kind in the world .
here the lives of eight do@@ zen T@@ aly@@ sh from the area who lived to older than 100 are documented . Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva points out a black & white photo .
this here is my grand@@ father , he was 120 years old .
at the age of 13@@ 6 he fa@@ ther@@ ed another child .
however , the un@@ ri@@ v@@ alled star of the museum is sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d Shir@@ ali Musli@@ mo@@ v who is said to have lived to 16@@ 8 years old .
however no birth certificate exists to confirm this .
and given that the longest confirmed li@@ fes@@ pan was 12@@ 2 years of age , Musli@@ mo@@ v 's claim seems extremely doub@@ t@@ ful .
`` He was born in 18@@ 05 , here in the region , and died in 1973 , '' explains Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva .
the man married three times and had 23 children , and is said to have fa@@ ther@@ ed another daughter at the age of 13@@ 6 .
so did Shir@@ ali Musli@@ mo@@ v mis@@ calculate his age by a couple of decades ?
but Rem@@ br@@ andt Sch@@ ol@@ z , re@@ sear@@ cher on ageing at the Max Plan@@ ck Institute in Ro@@ stock , has also heard of people living to impressive ages in Central Asia .
`` A stri@@ k@@ ingly high number of extremely elderly people can also be found in some areas of China , in Japan or the Hun@@ za Valley in Pakistan , '' said Sch@@ ol@@ z , `` while there is also an extremely large number of very old men in Sard@@ inia . ''
due to lacking documentation , however , there is no scientific proof of age , particularly as there are no birth regi@@ sters .
mel@@ ted but@@ ter by the glass , every day
however , the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding L@@ eri@@ k reach a bi@@ bli@@ cal age with striking regul@@ arity .
there are currently 20 individuals older than 100 years of age .
so why do so many very old people live here in the south ?
the Azer@@ i travel guide F@@ ari@@ d Mu@@ gi@@ m@@ z@@ ade@@ h explains this as being due to the special T@@ aly@@ sh gene@@ tics .
in contrast , Museum Director Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva believes that it is due to diet .
however the notion that the cal@@ orie = rich diet of the T@@ aly@@ sh , who love meat , bread and especially dairy products , and of whom many drink a glass of mel@@ ted but@@ ter on a daily basis , could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem pl@@ au@@ sible either .
or is it the traditional way of life that keeps the people young ? in C@@ en@@ ge@@ mi@@ ran , a tiny settlement not far from the town of L@@ eri@@ k , lives Ru@@ bab@@ a Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
at 97 years old she is still compar@@ atively young for the area .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva , who claims to have 14@@ 3 des@@ cen@@ dants , lives in a simple wooden house , which is typical of the entire Caucasus region .
she s@@ its on the floor with a but@@ ter chur@@ n , which she roll@@ s back@@ wards and for@@ wards ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
eight people live here under this roof , including one of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva 's sons and a daughter , both of whom have been grand@@ parents for some time .
there are also two small children running around .
in the kitchen , tea is prepared for the guests , which is served in typical , bul@@ ging Ar@@ ma@@ du gl@@ asses .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva 's white teeth stand in perfect rank and file , bene@@ ath her head@@ scar@@ f she conce@@ als long , dark b@@ lon@@ d pla@@ its , which her son pro@@ u@@ dly reveals for us .
I have always wash@@ ed my hair with milk , and it has never fallen out or lost its colour .
`` I have never used sh@@ am@@ po@@ o either , '' said Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
monthly pension is enough to live on
she has only ever e@@ aten what she could get from her own farm - tom@@ ato@@ es , pot@@ ato@@ es , pe@@ as .
my whole life I have never once bought gro@@ c@@ eries in the super@@ market .
then she tells of her husband who was in the army .
things were at their worst during the time after the Second World War .
however , everything became better when the `` bel@@ o@@ ved father '' He@@ y@@ dar Ali@@ ye@@ v took the ru@@ d@@ der .
the propaganda seems strange coming from the mouth of an old lady .
yet the cul@@ t that revol@@ ved around the father figure for the nation , who governed his country like a dict@@ ator practically knows no limits in Azer@@ bai@@ jan .
he held power until 2003 and his son Il@@ ham later took over the helm .
at least there is no de@@ priv@@ ation among Azer@@ bai@@ jan 's elderly .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva receives 230 Man@@ at ( around the same sum in euros ) per month as her pension , which in a local context is an amount on which one can live comfortably .
and perhaps Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva 's long gre@@ ying son is right : `` The elderly enjoy a deep respect in our culture . ''
they live among their extended family , are loved , c@@ ared for and are happy .
if this is not a reason to live for as long as possible , then what is ?
the notion of `` human rights '' is om@@ it@@ ted from the constitution .
the revolution has returned to C@@ airo .
competing demonstrations in C@@ airo reveal the deep division within the country .
the future constitution based on Sh@@ aria law is fi@@ erc@@ ely disp@@ uted .
the Egyptian President is not holding back his emo@@ tion .
we must make the transition .
`` And making sure it succ@@ ee@@ ds is my responsibility , before the people and before God , '' he said on state television .
his speech was aimed at the entire population , however in particular at the Cop@@ tic Christians , the liber@@ als , en@@ ligh@@ tened Muslims and se@@ cul@@ ari@@ sts .
for all of them , until now hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ly est@@ ran@@ ged in a be@@ wil@@ dered opposition , are fe@@ ar@@ ful .
they are fe@@ ar@@ ful of a God State on the Ni@@ le at the mer@@ cy of the powerful Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood .
according to Moh@@ amed Mur@@ si , speaking almost ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically , he has temporarily restricted the authority of the constitutional court and increased his own authority , `` in order to rescue the revolution . ''
however , Egyp@@ ti@@ ans - and the world - are not entirely sure what the 61 = year = old engine@@ er who holds a Doc@@ torate from the American University of Southern California , really wants to save .
should the judi@@ ciary be depri@@ ved of power ?
in actual fact , the 23@@ 4 articles , which have been pushed through by the Islamic = dominated 110 = person Constitu@@ ent Assembly , are in some aspects cause for concern .
as was also the case under previous constitu@@ tions , under the draft ju@@ dic@@ ature is justified on the `` principles of Islamic law . ''
yet what are `` principles '' ?
this was and remains subject to interpretation and there is concern that the Islam@@ ists will make use of the wo@@ ol@@ ly form@@ ulation and the resulting room for legal manoeu@@ vre in favour of a stricter interpretation of Sh@@ aria law .
this is at least suggested by one newly added article : in all issues affecting Sh@@ aria law , the Al Ash@@ ar University must be consulted , the country 's most important Islamic institution , which has great influence throughout the whole of Sun@@ ni Islam .
this can , but does not necessarily have to mean that the cl@@ ergy will over@@ see legislation , which would result in the de facto in@@ cap@@ ac@@ itation of the judi@@ ciary .
much in the constitutional draft is open to interpretation
also problematic : civil military jurisdiction will continue to be up@@ held .
during Mu@@ bar@@ ak 's rule , these courts served to sup@@ press opposition .
following the fall of the dict@@ ator , up to 11@@ ,000 civilians were under military imprison@@ ment .
according to the draft , the state should also protect `` the true character of the Egyptian family , and promote its mor@@ als and values . ''
from a legal perspective , this is formulated in such an unclear manner that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of cin@@ em@@ atic art and literature .
in plain language , this is nothing other than c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
incidentally , no article explicitly establishes the equality of men and women .
another does prohi@@ bit the insu@@ lt or s@@ lander of the pro@@ ph@@ et Moh@@ amed and his emis@@ s@@ aries .
however , what constitutes an insu@@ lt and how this should be sanc@@ tioned remains unclear .
equally du@@ bi@@ ous is the form@@ ulation stating that `` insul@@ ting people '' is forbidden .
is a car@@ ic@@ ature of the president sufficient , or a jo@@ ke at the expense of a jur@@ ist ?
open to interpretation , like so much in the draft submitted by Mur@@ si to be signed and that , in his own words , will be submitted to Egyp@@ ti@@ ans for referendum `` very soon . ''
`` The revolution is back ''
for weeks the opposition has been gathering to combat the superior strength of the Islam@@ ists .
tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square in C@@ airo , in un@@ familiar unity , and ple@@ dged to bring down the charter before it has even come into effect .
`` The revolution is back and we are going to be vic@@ tori@@ ous , '' said Ham@@ din Sab@@ b@@ ah@@ i , third place candidate in the presidential elections .
noble Peace Prize winner and former Head of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Authority , Moh@@ amed El = Bar@@ ade@@ i explained that the constitutional draft belongs `` on the rub@@ b@@ ish tip of history . ''
via SMS service Twitter , he accused Mur@@ si 's follo@@ wers of wanting to lead `` a coup against democracy . ''
`` If he calls for the referendum , we will go to his palace and over@@ throw him , '' said member of the opposition J@@ asser S@@ aid .
`` We have not yet grown tired , the blood of our bro@@ thers has not yet been at@@ oned for , '' stated the Egyptian media , quo@@ ting opposition politi@@ cian Chal@@ ed Ali .
and several judges have sign@@ alled that they do not want to over@@ see the referendum , which would render it invali@@ d .
`` The Kor@@ an is our constitution ''
the well = organised Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood gathered for a counter = demonstration , although acting cau@@ ti@@ ously they did not choose the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square but rather a mass pra@@ yer on the other side of the Ni@@ le , outside the C@@ airo University .
many v@@ ei@@ led women and follo@@ wers of the Sal@@ af@@ is took part , sh@@ ou@@ ting out : `` The people demand the application of God 's law . ''
they demanded of Mur@@ si : `` Cle@@ an@@ se the country ! '' and prote@@ sted : `` The Kor@@ an is our constitution . ''
a struggle for control over the symbolic T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square , where everything began , would have most likely provo@@ ked events ver@@ ging on civil war .
quite clearly , this was something that Mur@@ si 's follo@@ wers did not want to risk .
the Muslim Bro@@ thers stated that both those against and those in favour of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear .
now is the time to let the population decide at the bal@@ lot box , in which direction the country should move forward .
it is a certainty that there is a majority in favour of the Islam@@ ists ' draft .
`` The term ' human rights ' does not even appear once ''
Haf@@ ez Abu Sa@@ e@@ da is fur@@ ious about this forced constitu@@ tive process , which actually should have la@@ sted until February and should have involved all social interest groups .
the 48 = year = old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights ( E@@ O@@ HR ) defended the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood , when imprison@@ ed or in court under Mu@@ bar@@ ak .
not because he shared their world view , but because for him , human rights are indi@@ visible .
for this he was batter@@ ed , condemned and imprison@@ ed .
`` And now the term human rights does not even appear once in the new constitution , '' he be@@ mo@@ an@@ ed in a discussion with `` Welt am Sonntag . ''
the lawyer has re@@ signed himself to Mur@@ si extending his power to all three branches of state government .
these measures are b@@ lat@@ ant bre@@ aches of the ground rules of democracy and will guide Egypt into a new dictatorship .
`` In@@ stead of strengthening the civil society , the President is effectively suspen@@ ding it , '' compla@@ ined Sa@@ e@@ da .
yet without civil society organisations , a democracy can not function .
Sa@@ e@@ da feels abandoned , even by the international community , which is ob@@ serving the battle over the ideological direction on the Ni@@ le with a mixture of cur@@ i@@ osity and exc@@ itement .
this could come back to ha@@ unt them .
one demonstr@@ ator at the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r war@@ ned : `` You are let@@ ting loo@@ se a mon@@ ster that you can no longer control . ''
Norway 's rak@@ fis@@ k : is this the world 's sm@@ elli@@ est fish ?
Norway 's five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living , not just in Europe , but in the world .
could the secret of the country 's success be connected to the local ap@@ peti@@ te for some exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly sm@@ el@@ ly fish ?
take a selection of over = ri@@ pe che@@ es@@ es .
place them in the midst of a pi@@ le of dirty , wet so@@ ccer kit .
leave for a week .
now you have the nose = num@@ bing smell of rak@@ fis@@ k , one of the great Norwe@@ gian delic@@ ac@@ ies .
I am in the small town of F@@ ag@@ ern@@ es , about three hours from Oslo .
there is snow , spectacular scenery - and that od@@ our , ever present , han@@ gs in the air .
rak@@ fis@@ k is tro@@ ut sprin@@ kl@@ ed with salt and fer@@ mented in water for - depending on how sm@@ el@@ ly you like your fish - up to a year .
as the dark sets in and the weather turns cold , Norwe@@ gi@@ ans flo@@ ck to a festival here in F@@ ag@@ ern@@ es devoted to this most , well , cap@@ tiv@@ ating of foods .
`` You eat it raw , and then s@@ wal@@ low a glass of aqu@@ av@@ it , '' says Hav@@ ard Hal@@ var@@ sen , full = time local fire@@ figh@@ ter but also the so = called `` Rak@@ fis@@ k General , '' in charge of running the festival .
all around us people are eating little cu@@ bes of the fish and kno@@ cking back quantities of drink .
`` S@@ ome people like the aqu@@ av@@ it more than the rak@@ fis@@ k , '' says Hav@@ ard .
the drink can kill the smell .
I try a few pieces .
if you can avoid passing it under your nose , it is not bad - not unlike a sli@@ ce of sus@@ hi that has been on rather a long bus journey .
rak@@ fis@@ k is a product of very different , poverty = stri@@ cken times in Norway when , pre = refriger@@ ation , fish was so@@ aked in air@@ tight bar@@ rel@@ s of water and salt in autumn .
then in the dep@@ ths of winter , well and truly fer@@ mented , it is taken out and - no doubt with the senses kno@@ cked out by alcohol - e@@ aten .
only a generation ago , thousands of Norwe@@ gi@@ ans were forced to leave their country in search of work , em@@ ig@@ rating mainly to the US .
now the population is expanding fast - more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by pl@@ enti@@ ful jobs , high wages and a comprehensive care system .
people from Sweden , the old rival and not so long ago far ri@@ cher than Norway , stream in to work .
rak@@ fis@@ k is seen as signi@@ fying something important , a vital if rather sm@@ el@@ ly part of Norway 's past .
it is among the more expensive dishes you can buy .
but then everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sand@@ wich kno@@ ck you back £ 9 ( $ 14 ) each .
Norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda - and most seem to like it that way .
people here are still lo@@ ath to mention by name An@@ ders B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k , the right = wing , rac@@ ist extrem@@ ist who g@@ un@@ ned down and killed 77 men , women and children last year .
instead , the sho@@ ot@@ ings are referred to as `` the July the 2@@ 2nd incident . ''
Norwe@@ gi@@ ans find it very difficult to believe that in their peace = lo@@ ving country one of their own was capable of such bru@@ tality and murder .
the growth since the early 197@@ 0s of one of the world 's biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of Norway 's present = day wealth .
`` Bu@@ t oil is not the only reason we are doing so well , '' says Anna our wa@@ it@@ ress , hand@@ ing round tra@@ ys of mat@@ uring rak@@ fis@@ k and , with her long b@@ lon@@ d hair and star@@ tl@@ ingly blue eyes , the image of Nordic well = being .
we are a - how you say - pru@@ dent people .
her English , like that of most people here , is fla@@ w@@ less .
we are not very show@@ y , we do not like ost@@ entation .
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations .
when everyone else was thro@@ wing around money they did not have , in the years leading up to the global financial crash , Norway kept its pur@@ se str@@ ings tigh@@ tly bound .
`` As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer we are happy , '' says Anna .
`` And eat rak@@ fis@@ k , '' she adds with a care@@ free lau@@ gh .
I stand in the snow and qu@@ eu@@ e for something to eat - I have had enough rak@@ fis@@ k .
now an el@@ k burger is certainly something different and rather su@@ c@@ cul@@ ent to the taste .
but in the evening , it is more of that sm@@ el@@ ly fish .
the hotel I am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a rak@@ fis@@ k dinner where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most n@@ as@@ ally challenging - fish .
there is a live TV link up to a comp@@ ere in a bow tie surrounded by plates of rak@@ fis@@ k .
it is like the Euro@@ vision song contest .
`` What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains Th@@ or = Ju@@ er@@ gen ? ''
`` H@@ ere are our points , Hav@@ ard . ''
there is cla@@ pping , lau@@ ghter .
a man falls off his chair , perhaps overcome with aqu@@ av@@ it .
or maybe it is the f@@ umes from all that fish .
Mexico 's En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to faces tough start
as Mexico 's incoming President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to pre@@ pa@@ res to take office , the BBC 's Wil@@ l Gran@@ t looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population .
traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present .
a con@@ gest@@ ed city at the best of times , a ring of steel has been er@@ ected since Monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads .
the aim , however , was n't to stop comm@@ u@@ ters getting to work but prevent prote@@ sters from reaching parliament .
on Saturday , Mexico 's new president En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to will receive the presidential s@@ ash and take over the running of the nation .
he faces a complicated task .
Mexico has been performing well economically under the out@@ going administration of Feli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ on , but the country is in the gri@@ p of a drug war , which has already claimed an estimated 60@@ ,000 lives in six years .
`` My government has a great commitment to the Mexi@@ can people to reduce the violence , '' Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to told US President Barack Obama in the O@@ val Office earlier this week .
I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim .
before rub@@ bing shoul@@ ders with the US president , Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to 's previous political experience was as govern@@ or of his home state , the State of Mexico .
a popul@@ ous , spra@@ w@@ ling state surrounding the capital , opinions about the new leader are divided in his old stom@@ ping ground .
a straightforward man
in the bu@@ co@@ lic town of Valle del Bra@@ vo , for example , he is remember@@ ed fon@@ dly .
residents credit him with boo@@ sting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure .
to reach the town you can drive along one of Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to 's new motor@@ ways , a vast improvement on the cra@@ cked and bum@@ p@@ y roads it replaced .
pla@@ ques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about climate change .
`` We are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change , '' says friend and political ally G@@ abri@@ el Ol@@ ver@@ a Her@@ n@@ an@@ dez , a state con@@ gres@@ s@@ man for Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to 's party , the PR@@ I .
particularly in terms of security and the economy , we ' re hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so badly needs .
after an un@@ broken 81 years in power , the PR@@ I was ou@@ sted in 2000 by Vic@@ ente Fo@@ x .
Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man Ol@@ ver@@ a ad@@ mits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pin@@ os , there is much expec@@ tation within the party about En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to .
and he re@@ jects the opposition 's character@@ isation of the new president as lacking substance .
he 's a very straightforward man , very committed with an excellent vision of the country .
he 's an excellent stat@@ es@@ man and , above all , he 's someone who knows how to listen .
but on the other side of the state , that is not the impression many people have of their former govern@@ or .
in Ne@@ zah@@ u@@ alco@@ yo@@ t@@ l , also known as Ci@@ u@@ dad ne@@ za , the contrast with the co@@ b@@ bled streets of Valle del Bra@@ vo could n't be shar@@ per .
tu@@ cked away under motorway fl@@ yo@@ vers , it is in many ways a sub@@ ur@@ b of Mexico City itself .
and the problems in the municipality are also gr@@ it@@ ty and urban .
earlier this year , the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the neighbour@@ ho@@ ods , and violence against women is particularly acute .
on a patch of wa@@ st@@ eland by a vast land@@ fill site , the bodies of do@@ zens of mur@@ dered women have been dump@@ ed over the past two years alone .
more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to was govern@@ or , a rate much higher than in the not@@ ori@@ ously violent city of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z - a place syn@@ onymous with the murder of innocent women .
Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to 's critics say , at best , he failed to adequately address the problem of fem@@ ici@@ de while he was in office .
at worst , they acc@@ use his administration of turning a blind eye .
in a concrete home typical of the run@@ down neighbourhood , I@@ rin@@ ea Bu@@ en@@ dia stru@@ gg@@ les to fight back the te@@ ars as she shows me photos of her late daughter , Mari@@ ana L@@ una .
according to the official version of events , Mari@@ ana committed suici@@ de in 2010 .
however her family believes she was mur@@ dered by her partner .
`` W@@ hen I arrived at her house it seemed her body had been wash@@ ed , '' S@@ enor@@ a Bu@@ en@@ dia rec@@ alls .
there were signs she 'd been be@@ aten , and rig@@ or mor@@ tis had already set in .
as her mother re@@ counts the story , a picture of Mari@@ ana looks down from the walls , next to a cross bearing a single word : justice .
however , that is exactly what the family say they have been denied .
the state authorities have treated me like I 'm an old go@@ ssi@@ p , a trouble = maker , a wh@@ iner .
what they want is that one simply accepts what they say and sh@@ uts up .
`` Bu@@ t that ca n't be right when there were so many irregularities and om@@ is@@ sions , '' she says .
as President P@@ ena Nie@@ to receives the s@@ ash on Saturday , it comes with a heavy responsibility .
tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office .
`` I hope he 's the same kind of president as he was a govern@@ or , '' says PR@@ I Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man Ol@@ ver@@ a in Valle del Bra@@ vo .
that , however , is exactly what victims ' families in Ci@@ u@@ dad ne@@ za most fear .
Bra@@ d@@ ley Mann@@ ing did n't compla@@ in about mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , prosec@@ ut@@ ors con@@ tend
prosec@@ ut@@ ors try to counter Bra@@ d@@ ley Mann@@ ing 's claims of abuse in con@@ fin@@ ement
the hearing focuses on Mann@@ ing 's time in the military bri@@ g at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Vir@@ g@@ inia
defense wants case dis@@ missed on grounds that Mann@@ ing 's con@@ fin@@ ement was harsh
the Army private is accused of ste@@ aling thousands of classified documents
prosec@@ ut@@ ors tried to establish Friday that Army private Bra@@ d@@ ley Mann@@ ing -- charged in the largest le@@ ak of classified material in U.S. history -- missed multiple opportunities to compla@@ in about the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment he 's alleg@@ ing he suffered in military cu@@ sto@@ dy .
while cross = examining Mann@@ ing at a pre = trial hearing at F@@ t . Me@@ ade , Mar@@ y@@ land , prosec@@ utor Maj@@ . Ash@@ den F@@ ein asser@@ ted that records of weekly visits Mann@@ ing had with unit officers during nine months of detention at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Vir@@ g@@ inia , show no complaints about his treatment .
the cross = examination -- during a hearing on a defense motion to have Mann@@ ing 's case dis@@ missed on grounds that his con@@ fin@@ ement has been harsh and has amoun@@ ted to enough punishment -- came a day after Mann@@ ing t@@ esti@@ fied that he had considered suici@@ de while in cu@@ sto@@ dy .
the Army intelligence analy@@ st , arrested in June 2010 , is accused of ste@@ aling thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq .
the material was then published online by Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
Wiki@@ Le@@ aks has never confirmed that Mann@@ ing was the source of its information .
in Friday 's hearing , F@@ ein reviewed with Mann@@ ing the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Mann@@ ing during his detention at Qu@@ an@@ tico 's bri@@ g , where he was held under a hei@@ gh@@ tened con@@ fin@@ ement status from July 2010 to April 2011 .
officers would ask Mann@@ ing questions and write down his responses .
when F@@ ein asked about the forms Friday , Mann@@ ing acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guards as `` excellent '' and treatment by the facility overall as `` very professional . ''
the forms show no complaints of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , even though the officers asked Mann@@ ing directly about his treatment , F@@ ein con@@ ten@@ ded .
man@@ ning responded that he would verb@@ ally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed , but they did n't record the issues .
`` Th@@ ey would write down ' no issues ' ( after discussing the concerns ) , and it did n't necessarily mean I did n't bring something up , '' Mann@@ ing said .
the judge , Army Col@@ . Den@@ ise Lin@@ d , also asked Mann@@ ing why he did n't compla@@ in about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board examining the suici@@ dal thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier .
man@@ ning rep@@ lied that his intention during that meeting was to get his `` prevention of injury '' status down@@ gra@@ ded .
the military said they put him on this restrictive status -- a step below suici@@ de watch -- for his protection and the safety of others .
`` I wanted staff to know I was fine , and ( I wanted to ) get off the PO@@ I status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my view@@ point , '' Mann@@ ing said .
man@@ ning t@@ esti@@ fied Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Ku@@ wait , where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the bri@@ g at Marine Base Qu@@ an@@ tico in Vir@@ g@@ inia in July 2010 .
he said he con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated suici@@ de in Ku@@ wait and once passed out there due to the heat .
he said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was dist@@ ressing .
`` My world just shr@@ ink to Camp Ara@@ f@@ j@@ on , to that c@@ age , '' Mann@@ ing said Thursday .
I thought I was going to die in that c@@ age .
once at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Mann@@ ing said , he spend most days in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- with no company .
man@@ ning said he was allowed only a mat@@ t@@ ress , blan@@ ket , fli@@ p = flo@@ ps , some clothes and his gl@@ asses .
he said he tried to keep moving , because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules .
man@@ ning said he always sle@@ pt with light from outside his cell in his eyes .
if guards could not see his face when he rolled over at night , he said they would wake him to roll back over .
man@@ ning 's lawyer filed a formal objec@@ tion to Mann@@ ing 's treatment in January 2011 .
man@@ ning was moved to the military prison at Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , K@@ ans@@ as , in April 2011 .
also Friday , the judge asked Mann@@ ing about an alleg@@ ation that he made in Thursday 's testim@@ ony -- that after being forced to sleep n@@ aked one night in his Qu@@ an@@ tico cell , he was forced to stand n@@ aked in front of guards and other in@@ m@@ ates during a morning head count .
man@@ ning had t@@ esti@@ fied that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blan@@ ket during the head count .
under ques@@ tioning from the judge Friday , Mann@@ ing said that he in@@ fer@@ red from his guard 's order that he should drop a blan@@ ket that could have covered him , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it .
man@@ ning t@@ esti@@ fied Thursday that he was forced to sleep n@@ aked the previous night because of his attempt to show an officer that he was n't a danger to himself .
man@@ ning said that he told the officer that he could have used the wa@@ ist@@ band of his under@@ wear or his fli@@ p = flo@@ ps to hur@@ t himself but had n't done so .
that night , Mann@@ ing t@@ esti@@ fied , his under@@ wear , fli@@ p = flo@@ ps and gl@@ asses were removed from his cell .
his lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences during con@@ fin@@ ement into account and shar@@ ply reduce his sentence should he be convi@@ cted at his court = mar@@ tial , which is expected to begin early next year .
the defense has said it plans to have Mann@@ ing ple@@ ad guilty to less@@ er off@@ enses and fight other charges as being too extreme .
the hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend , with prosec@@ ut@@ ors expected to argue that the detention conditions were warran@@ ted .
the Pent@@ ag@@ on has maintained that Mann@@ ing was held in accordance with rules governing all maximum = cu@@ sto@@ dy de@@ tain@@ ees at Qu@@ an@@ tico .
counts against Mann@@ ing include ai@@ ding the enemy , w@@ ron@@ g@@ fully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet , trans@@ mitting national defense information and the@@ ft of public property or records .
if he 's convi@@ cted on all counts , he could face a life sentence .
my Mexi@@ can = American identity crisis
he says many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there
Mex@@ ic@@ ans tend to fault those who left ; they remind Mex@@ ic@@ ans of hard times , he says
Nav@@ arre@@ tte says Mexi@@ can = Americans are caught between two worlds
on a recent trip to Mexico City , I had barely made my way down the con@@ course and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got st@@ um@@ ped .
signs pointed the way to two lines : one for `` m@@ ex@@ ic@@ an@@ os '' ( `` Mex@@ ic@@ ans '' ) , another for `` ex@@ tran@@ jer@@ os '' ( `` Fore@@ igners . '' )
I stood there for a few seconds , un@@ sure of where to go .
growing up in Central California , I had been called a `` Mexi@@ can '' my entire life .
it 's ethnic shor@@ th@@ and in the same way that my friends in Bo@@ ston refer to themselves as `` Irish '' or my friends in New York describe themselves as `` Italian . ''
later , I settled on `` Mexi@@ can = American . ''
but , this was Mexico .
and , in the hom@@ eland of my grand@@ father , there was no need for shor@@ th@@ and or hy@@ ph@@ ens .
I was simply an American .
I speak Spanish , good enough to handle either end of an interview in that language .
but I do n't have the voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary of a native , and I ca n't sha@@ ke my American acc@@ ent .
so I took my U.S. passport and got in the line for ex@@ tran@@ jer@@ os .
I thought about that moment this week when Mexi@@ can president = elect En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to visited the White House to meet with President Obama .
on the agenda , as usual , when the leaders of these two countries meet : immigration , drugs and trade .
pen@@ a Nie@@ to was also e@@ ager to talk about the growth of the Mexi@@ can economy , which is one reason that Mex@@ ic@@ ans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States .
he wants to partner with the United States and Canada , and create a European Union = style trading blo@@ c in North America .
and P@@ ena Nie@@ to vo@@ wed to continue Mexico 's war against the drug car@@ tels , even though he offered no specific@@ s .
for Mexico , the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard feelings .
most Americans probably never give a thought to the fact that , in 18@@ 48 , the United States inv@@ aded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of ri@@ f@@ le .
but for Mex@@ ic@@ ans , who think in terms of centuries , not minutes , the remin@@ ders are everywhere .
so the minute that a U.S. official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico , you start hearing -- in the Mexi@@ can press , and among the eli@@ tes -- complaints about how the Americans are en@@ cro@@ aching upon their neighb@@ or 's sovereignty .
and the children of Monte@@ zu@@ ma go on the war@@ path .
and yet , for Mexico , the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexi@@ can = Americans living in the United States .
you want to talk about hard feelings ?
there is plenty .
Mexico has winners and lo@@ sers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does n't .
the only reason you have so many people of Mexi@@ can anc@@ est@@ ry living in cities like Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Pho@@ enix , Den@@ ver or San Antonio is because , at some point in our family tree , there was a person , maybe a parent or grand@@ parent , who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north .
and more often than not , that person fit a profile -- dark skin , little education , from a poor village , etc .
we ' re their off@@ spring , and we ' re lo@@ yal to them .
not Mexico .
and even though we may now be living the American Dre@@ am , having gone to good schools and taken good jobs , we can never lose sight of the fact that it 's the American Dre@@ am we ' re living , and not the Mexi@@ can one .
our identity might sometimes be fu@@ zz@@ y , but our loy@@ alty is clear .
it 's to the United States .
besides , we ' re aware that many of the elite Mex@@ ic@@ ans in the ruling class do n't like us .
the feeling is mutual .
they see us as a remin@@ der of a hum@@ ili@@ ating defeat and look down on us as inf@@ eri@@ or stock that is n't sufficiently Mexi@@ can .
our Spanish will never be good enough , our ties to Mexico never strong enough .
our existence is , as they see it , all about failure .
if our families had n't failed in Mexico , they would n't have left .
and we would n't now find ourselves tra@@ pped behind the sil@@ k cur@@ tain , living well in the United States but lost sou@@ ls nonetheless .
my wife , who was born in Guad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara and came to the United States legally as a child , remin@@ ds me that there is fri@@ ction between Mex@@ ic@@ ans and Mexi@@ can = Americans because Mex@@ ic@@ ans have a fir@@ mer gra@@ sp of who they are and Mexi@@ can = Americans res@@ ent that .
while she 's a U.S. citizen , she sees herself as a part of two countries .
meanwhile , many Mexi@@ can = Americans I know do n't feel like they ' re a part of either .
we love listening to the Mexi@@ can band , Los T@@ ig@@ res del Nor@@ te , but also to Bru@@ ce Spr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en .
you get the best of both worlds , but you ' re roo@@ ted in neither .
in Mexico , we ' re seen as Americans .
and in the United States , we ' re considered Mexi@@ can .
now , to complic@@ ate the relationship even further , as I learned during my trip , some Mexi@@ can leaders and parts of the intelligent@@ sia want to re@@ connect with the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a .
they want to put Mexi@@ can = Americans to work as ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft `` amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors '' for Mexico , representing its interest in the United States .
we would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico .
ye@@ ah .
that 's not going to happen .
too many hard feelings .
and , with income inequality and ra@@ mp@@ ant corruption and drug violence , many of us are not so sure that it is a great country .
I 'm afraid you ' re on your own , am@@ ig@@ os .
that 's fair .
if at least some Mex@@ ic@@ ans are n't yet ready to for@@ give the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago , then they have to accept the fact that some Mexi@@ can = Americans still hold a gru@@ dge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that .
h@@ mm@@ m .
maybe we ' re more `` Mexi@@ can '' than I thought .
old batt@@ les , new Middle East
the ce@@ ase@@ fire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace
can there ever be a lasting peace between Ara@@ bs and Jews in the Middle East ?
another round of blo@@ od@@ shed suggests that any such hope is v@@ ain .
am@@ id the usual fu@@ tile arguments over who started it , scores of buildings have been reduced to rub@@ ble ; more than 140 Palestinians , most of them civilians , and six Israelis have been killed ; and , for the first time , missi@@ les from Gaza have land@@ ed near Tel Avi@@ v , Israel 's metro@@ polis , and the hol@@ y city of Jerusalem .
but though the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict , all around them the Middle East is changing .
the Arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air , and , like it or not , the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in the regional tur@@ mo@@ il .
maybe this will make their struggle blo@@ odi@@ er than before .
however , there are reasons for thinking it could just break their le@@ th@@ al stal@@ em@@ ate .
a war that is neither lost or won
at first sight , optim@@ ism looks very hard to justify now .
even if the ce@@ ase@@ fire agreed on November 21st holds , this week 's fighting has strengthened the ha@@ w@@ ks on both sides .
the leaders of Hamas , the Islam@@ ist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , will claim to have forced the Israelis to back off , even though Gaza has taken a dru@@ b@@ bing .
despite killing some of its leaders and bott@@ ling up Gaza 's 1.@@ 7@@ m people in one of the most w@@ ret@@ ched and crow@@ ded cor@@ ners of the planet , Israel has failed to destroy Hamas .
indeed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank , the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter ri@@ vals in Fat@@ ah , the more moderate Palestinian fac@@ tion .
moreover , Hamas 's leaders may well conclude that time is on their side .
as Islam@@ ists across the Arab world have gained cl@@ out , so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends .
Turkey , a res@@ urgent regional power that was once Israel 's closest Muslim ally , has taken up Hamas 's cause ; so has Q@@ atar , one of the rich@@ est and most dynamic of the Gulf states .
ju@@ bil@@ ant Hamas people say an Islam@@ ist c@@ res@@ cent is cur@@ ving around Israel , from Lebanon in the north , where the H@@ iz@@ bul@@ lah party = c@@ um = m@@ ili@@ tia holds s@@ way , through Syria , where re@@ bels of an increasingly Islam@@ ist bent may t@@ opp@@ le Bas@@ h@@ ar As@@ sad , and on down through Jordan , where Hamas 's allies are men@@ ac@@ ing the king .
above all , on Israel 's southern flan@@ k , the rise of the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood under President Mu@@ ham@@ mad Mor@@ si in Egypt , by far the most popul@@ ous and pi@@ vo@@ tal of Arab countries , has changed the region 's balance .
Ho@@ sn@@ i Mu@@ bar@@ ak , the se@@ cular des@@ pot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his down@@ fall in 2011 , had little time for Hamas .
by contrast , the Bro@@ ther@@ hood is a c@@ ous@@ in of Hamas , and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion .
in future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an actor that can not be shut out even by Israel and America .
meanwhile , Israel 's hard@@ lin@@ ers will draw the opposite conclusions .
in military terms , Hamas has been put back in its box .
Israel 's Ir@@ on D@@ ome anti = missi@@ le system has proved its worth and many of Hamas 's missi@@ les have been destroyed .
Israelis will sleep more sound@@ ly - for a while .
in diplomatic terms , America is as ste@@ ad@@ fast as ever ; many European countries also bl@@ amed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence .
above all , Israel has pro@@ sp@@ ered , especially under Bin@@ y@@ amin Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u , a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process .
although ro@@ ckets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel has been fairly free of suici@@ de = bom@@ bers , thanks in part to the barrier that bit@@ es into the West Bank , the main ch@@ unk of a would = be Palestinian state , and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illeg@@ ality in international law .
Mr Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u , whose Li@@ ku@@ d party has mer@@ ged with an even more ha@@ w@@ k@@ ish lot under Avi@@ g@@ dor Lie@@ ber@@ man in the run = up to an election on January 2@@ 2nd , is sitting pretty .
why co@@ ddle those twi@@ sty Palestinians by giving them a state of their own ?
if they really ran the West Bank , would they not fire ro@@ ckets , just as their comp@@ atri@@ ots have done in Gaza ?
better to keep them behind that wall and sm@@ ite them if they raise their heads .
maybe the hard@@ lin@@ ers will win out ; yet the Arab spring may change their calculations .
even if the Islam@@ ists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel , their priority will be tackling difficulties at home .
Israel 's defence budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined .
starting a war with the local super@@ power will hardly help the new Arab governments mend their economies .
that the pragmatic Mr Mor@@ si worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ce@@ ase@@ fire au@@ g@@ urs well - and might just mark the start of something .
Israelis too should look to the longer term .
with the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , depri@@ ving Palestinians of their right to self = determination is creating a powder ke@@ g that is bound one day to explo@@ de in the territories occupied by Israel - much as a bus explo@@ ded in Tel Avi@@ v this week .
repression is already under@@ mining democracy in the Jewish state , and demo@@ graphy exacerb@@ ates this as the Arab population sw@@ ells .
blo@@ ody missions against Gaza every few years to kno@@ ck back Hamas will exact a growing diplomatic toll .
both sides need pro@@ dding by out@@ si@@ ders
the answer remains the one tru@@ mp@@ eted by sensible people on both sides , most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states , with Israel ce@@ ding territory for security .
the hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ce@@ ase@@ fire will give a little more le@@ verage to out@@ si@@ ders pushing that cause .
Egypt , which must now set about st@@ opping the flow of arms into Gaza , along with Turkey and Q@@ atar , is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 boundaries with land sw@@ aps and a shared Jerusalem .
Arab out@@ si@@ ders should also press Hamas and Fat@@ ah to come together .
that would do more to create a Palestinian state than the im@@ min@@ ent bid for virtual stat@@ eh@@ ood at the UN .
Mr Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table .
during his first term , he negle@@ cted to present his own plan for peace .
back in the White House , he is looking just as reluc@@ tant to be drawn in .
this is wo@@ e@@ fully short = si@@ ghted .
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East .
that means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians .
cigare@@ tte plain packaging laws come into force in Australia
smoking war@@ nings and dise@@ ased body parts em@@ bla@@ z@@ oned on d@@ ull green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands
Australia 's world = first laws on cigare@@ tte and tobacco plain packaging have come into force , replacing brand logos and colours with generic dra@@ b olive green cover@@ ings , gru@@ es@@ ome pictures of dise@@ ased body parts and depic@@ tions of children and bab@@ ies made ill by their parents ' smoking .
apart from the varying health war@@ nings and images the only difference between the p@@ acks , mandatory from Saturday , are the brand names , and these are all printed in identical small font .
it is the world 's most strict regime for the packaging of tobacco .
Australia 's federal government says the aim is to deter young people from smoking by stri@@ pping the hab@@ it of gl@@ am@@ our .
it is rel@@ ying on studies showing that if people have not started smoking by age 26 there is a 99 % chance they will never take it up .
`` E@@ ven from a very early age you can see that kids understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their br@@ anding , '' said the federal health minister , T@@ any@@ a P@@ liber@@ se@@ k , c@@ iting studies that showed , for example , children linking a cro@@ wn in a logo with the idea of being a prin@@ c@@ ess .
while Australia has one of the world 's lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on multination@@ als ' profits , other countries are considering similar steps .
the tobacco industry lob@@ bi@@ ed hard against the laws .
tobacco firms said they would boost black market trade , leading to cheaper , more accessible cigare@@ ttes .
`` There will be serious un@@ intended consequences from the legislation , '' said Scott Mc@@ In@@ ty@@ re of British American Tob@@ acco Australia .
counterf@@ eit@@ ers from China and Indonesia will bring lots more of these products down to sell on the streets of Australia .
others say the laws have boo@@ sted their business .
Sand@@ ra H@@ a of Z@@ ico Import P@@ ty Ltd , a small family business , said demand for cigare@@ tte cases , si@@ lic@@ on covers to mask the un@@ pal@@ at@@ able packages , had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since British American Tob@@ acco , Britain 's Imperial Tob@@ acco , Phili@@ p Mor@@ ris and Japan Tob@@ acco lost a challenge to the laws in Australia 's high court .
ha said Z@@ ico had sold up to 6@@ ,000 to wholes@@ ale out@@ lets and was awaiting new stock .
this is good business for us .
the potential hit@@ ch , experts say , is the popularity of social media with the very demographic the plan is targe@@ ting .
after a series of Australian laws bann@@ ing TV advertising and sports spon@@ sor@@ ship and requiring most s@@ ellers to hide cigare@@ ttes from view , tobacco marketing has moved online .
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites but can not restrict overseas sites .
`` If you are a tobacco mark@@ eter and you 've only got this small window left to promote your products , online is the comp@@ elling place for you to be in , '' said Be@@ cky Fre@@ em@@ an , a public health re@@ sear@@ cher at Sydney University .
Fre@@ em@@ an noted an increase in `` average Jo@@ e '' reviews of brands on social media sites such as YouTube , Twitter and Facebook .
we have to ask , is that just a private citizen who really lo@@ ves Mar@@ l@@ bor@@ o cigare@@ ttes and they 've gone to the trouble of making a video , or is there a marketing company involved ?
British American Tob@@ acco Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing .
the industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine , Hon@@ dur@@ as and the Domini@@ can Republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claim@@ ing at the World Trade Organisation that trade is being un@@ fairly restricted , despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australia .
a WTO ruling is likely in mid = 2013 .
P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said the government had held discussions with other countries considering similar laws on packaging .
Canada was the first country to make photogra@@ ph war@@ nings mandatory in 2001 .
they now extend to more than 40 countries including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
tou@@ gher laws are being considered in Britain , New Zealand , South Africa and India .
many smo@@ kers in Australia remain de@@ fi@@ ant .
the pictures do n't affect me .
I just ignore them .
`` You just gra@@ b a smoke and put it away , '' said Vic@@ tor El H@@ age as he purchased a pack with a photogra@@ ph of a mouth tum@@ our .
honest@@ ly , there 's only one reason I 'd stop , and that 's my little girl .
James Y@@ u , who runs the King of the Pack tob@@ ac@@ con@@ ist in central Sydney , said the uniform packaging made it harder to st@@ ack his shel@@ ves
`` It used to take me an hour to un@@ load a delivery , now it takes me four hours , '' Y@@ u said .
`` The government should have just banned them altogether and then we 'd go OK , fine , we ' re done , we 'll shut up shop , '' he said , thro@@ wing his hands up in the air .
in a Con@@ st@@ antly P@@ lug@@ ged = In World , It 's Not All Bad to B@@ e Bo@@ red
I spent five unexpected hours in an airport this Th@@ an@@ ks@@ giving holiday when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive .
so I had plenty of time to think about the subject of bo@@ re@@ dom .
I wo n't lie to you .
half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty te@@ di@@ ous , even with the di@@ stra@@ ctions of books , magazines and i@@ Ph@@ ones ( not to mention duty = free shopping ) .
but increasingly , some ac@@ adem@@ ics and child development experts are coming out in praise of bo@@ re@@ dom .
it 's all right for us - and our children - to be bo@@ red on occasion , they say .
it forces the brain to go on interesting tan@@ g@@ ents , perhaps fo@@ stering creativity .
and because most of us are almost consistently p@@ lug@@ ged into one screen or another these days , we do n't experience the benefits of bo@@ re@@ dom .
so should we embra@@ ce bo@@ re@@ dom ?
yes .
and no .
but I 'll get back to that .
first of all , like many people , I assumed that bo@@ re@@ dom was a relatively recent phenomenon , with the adv@@ ent of more leisure time .
not so , says Peter To@@ oh@@ ey , a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Cal@@ g@@ ary in Canada and the author of `` bo@@ re@@ dom : a Li@@ vely History '' ( Y@@ ale University Press , 2011 ) .
`` bo@@ re@@ dom actually has a very long history , '' he said .
there 's Latin gra@@ ff@@ iti about bo@@ re@@ dom on the walls of Pom@@ p@@ ei@@ i dating from the first century .
then there 's the question of how we define bo@@ re@@ dom .
the trouble is that it has been defined , and discussed , in many different ways , said John D. E@@ ast@@ wood , an associ@@ ate professor of psych@@ ology at York University in On@@ tari@@ o , Canada .
after looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues defined bo@@ re@@ dom as an experience of `` wanting to , but being unable to engage in satis@@ fying activity . ''
what separ@@ ates bo@@ re@@ dom from ap@@ ath@@ y , he said , is that the person is not engaged but wants to be .
with ap@@ ath@@ y , he said , there is no urge to do something .
the core experience of bo@@ re@@ dom , he said , is `` dis@@ ruption of the attention process , associated with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slowly . ''
bo@@ re@@ dom can sound an aw@@ ful lot like de@@ pression .
but Professor E@@ ast@@ wood said that while they can be related , people who are bo@@ red tend to see the problem as the environment or the world , while people who are de@@ pressed see the problem as themselves .
sometimes we think we ' re bo@@ red when we just have difficulty concent@@ rating .
in their study , `` The un@@ engaged Min@@ d : defining bo@@ re@@ dom in Terms of At@@ tention , '' which appeared in the jour@@ nal Per@@ spec@@ tives on Psych@@ ological Science in September , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article .
some groups heard a loud and un@@ related television program in the next room , others heard it at a low level so it was barely notic@@ eable , while the third group did n't hear the sound@@ track at all .
the ones who heard the low = level TV reported more bo@@ re@@ dom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concent@@ rating but were not sure why , and attri@@ buted that difficulty to bo@@ re@@ dom .
when you ' re trying to focus on a difficult or eng@@ aging task , dis@@ ruption of attention can lead to bo@@ re@@ dom , said Mark J. F@@ ens@@ ke , an associ@@ ate professor of neuro@@ science at the University of Gu@@ el@@ ph in On@@ tari@@ o and one of the authors of the study .
on the other hand , when you ' re doing something d@@ ull , `` such as looking for bad wid@@ gets on a factory line , di@@ stra@@ cting music can help you not be bo@@ red . ''
in fact , he said , we now know that squ@@ ir@@ ming and do@@ od@@ ling , often seen as a sign of bo@@ re@@ dom , can actually help combat it by keeping people more physi@@ cally alert .
`` Research shows that kids who are allowed to fi@@ d@@ get learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still , '' Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said .
we all experience bo@@ re@@ dom at some points - my flight delay , a dr@@ oning speaker , a particularly te@@ di@@ ous movie .
but some individuals are more likely to be bo@@ red than others .
to help measure this , researchers developed a `` bo@@ re@@ dom pron@@ eness Sc@@ ale '' in the 1980s .
the scale includes questions like , `` M@@ any things I have to do are re@@ peti@@ tive and mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous , '' and `` I have so many interests , I do n't have time to do everything . ''
using such sc@@ ales , researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bo@@ red more often than girls , said Stephen Vo@@ dan@@ o@@ vi@@ ch , a professor of psych@@ ology at the University of West Florida , especially when it comes nee@@ ding more , and a variety of , external stim@@ ulation .
but in general , teen@@ agers are a pretty j@@ aded lot .
in 1991 , Re@@ ed Lar@@ son , a professor of human and community development at the University of Il@@ lin@@ ois , conducted an experiment in which he cont@@ acted almost 400 teen@@ agers and their parents seven to eight times a day by be@@ eper .
he found that 32 percent of ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents said they were bo@@ red in school and doing home@@ work , while 23 percent said they were bo@@ red when they were n't in school .
on the other hand , 3 percent of parents said they were bo@@ red .
Professor Lar@@ son said he did not know whether the bo@@ re@@ dom percent@@ ages now , 21 years later , would be higher or lower .
but he said he did know that `` ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence is a peak period for bo@@ re@@ dom , '' largely because children and teen@@ agers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do .
so back to my original question : is bo@@ re@@ dom good for you ?
sometimes no , because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks , gam@@ ble or indul@@ ge in substance abuse as a way to ease it , research shows .
on the other hand , many philosop@@ h@@ ers and writers discuss the connection between bo@@ re@@ dom and creativity , said Professor Vo@@ dan@@ o@@ vi@@ ch , who has been studying the issue for more than two decades .
`` bo@@ re@@ dom is the brain 's way to tell you you should be doing something else , '' said G@@ ary Mar@@ cus , a professor of psych@@ ology at N@@ .@@ Y@@ .@@ U@@ .
but the brain does n't always know the most appropriate thing to do .
if you ' re bo@@ red and use that energy to play guitar and co@@ ok , it will make you happy .
but if you watch TV , it may make you happy in the short term , but not in the long term .
so if your child is bo@@ red and you give him an iP@@ ad , he may not be bo@@ red anymore , but he has n't learned how to enter@@ tain himself , or self regulate , Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said .
and `` that self = regulation transfers from one situation to other , '' he said .
your k@@ id does n't just learn to enter@@ tain himself , but gets more self = control in other areas .
I do n't think we really want to celebrate bo@@ re@@ dom .
nor should we be too critical of it .
rather , our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant chat@@ ter of activity and technology .
Professor E@@ ast@@ wood agreed .
`` We frame it as we need to be bo@@ red more , but bo@@ re@@ dom is an ag@@ on@@ izing , rest@@ less desire to be connected with something meaningful , '' he said .
what people are really searching for , he said , is a way to un@@ plug and enjoy down time .
`` In an environment where we are constantly o@@ vers@@ tim@@ ulated , '' he said , `` it 's hard to find ways to engage when the noise sh@@ uts down . ''
in Col@@ or@@ ado , No play@@ book for New Mari@@ ju@@ ana Law
Anth@@ ony O@@ ro@@ z@@ co , 19 , a community college student and so@@ ccer player in sou@@ the@@ astern Col@@ or@@ ado , is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this state : the possession of a few nu@@ g@@ gets of mari@@ ju@@ ana and a pipe he used to smoke it .
Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co said that one day in September he and a few friends were driving in Lam@@ ar , on the pla@@ ins near the K@@ ans@@ as border , when they were pul@@ led over .
after the police officer found mari@@ ju@@ ana in the car , Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co was issued a sum@@ mon@@ s for possession and drug par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia - pet@@ ty off@@ enses that each carry a $ 100 fine - and given a court date .
`` We get treated like criminals , '' Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co said .
but is he one ?
in the uncertain weeks after Col@@ or@@ ado 's vote to leg@@ alize small amounts of mari@@ ju@@ ana for recreational use , the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location .
hundreds of mis@@ de@@ mean@@ or mari@@ ju@@ ana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State , which approved a similar measure .
police departments have stopped charging adults 21 years and older for small = scale possession that will be legally sanc@@ tioned once the laws take effect in the coming weeks .
but prosec@@ ut@@ ors in more conservative prec@@ inc@@ ts in Col@@ or@@ ado have vo@@ wed to press ahead with existing mari@@ ju@@ ana cases and are still c@@ iting people for possession .
at the same time , several towns from the Den@@ ver sub@@ ur@@ bs to the Western mountains are voting to block new , state = licensed retail mari@@ ju@@ ana shops from opening in their communities .
`` This thing is evol@@ ving so quickly that I do n't know what 's going to happen next , '' said Daniel J. O@@ ates , the police chief in A@@ ur@@ ora , just east of Den@@ ver .
regul@@ ators in Washington State are also scrat@@ ching their heads .
and they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses for production , manufacturing , distribution and sales - all by a deadline of De@@ c . 1 , 2013 .
they say that Col@@ or@@ ado , for better or worse , is ahead of most states in regulating mari@@ ju@@ ana , first for medical use and now recre@@ ation@@ ally .
`` Col@@ or@@ ado has a more regulated market , so they will be a good guide , '' said Bri@@ an E. Smith , a sp@@ ok@@ es@@ man for the Washington State Li@@ qu@@ or Control Board .
but no place or system , Mr. Smith conc@@ eded , can do more than suggest what might work .
`` There 's no real precedent for us to follow , '' he said .
Washington 's law , called I = 50@@ 2 , takes effect on De@@ c . 6 , which also leaves a year of li@@ mb@@ o during which the state licensing system will not yet exist , but leg@@ alized possession will .
and there are thor@@ ny mechanical questions that must be resolved during that time , like how to balance the state 's mandate of `` adequate access '' to licensed mari@@ ju@@ ana with its prohi@@ bitions on c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is businesses within 1,000 feet of a school , park , playground or child care center .
`` No@@ where will it be more difficult to site a licensed c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is business than in urban areas , particularly in the Seattle metro@@ politan area , '' said Ben Li@@ v@@ ing@@ ston , a sp@@ ok@@ es@@ man for the Center for Legal Cann@@ ab@@ is , a recently formed research group .
on No@@ v . 21 , Chief O@@ ates in A@@ ur@@ ora sent his officers an e = mail announ@@ cing that the city att@@ or@@ ney would no longer be prosec@@ uting small mari@@ ju@@ ana violations for anyone 21 years or older , and that the police would stop charging people for those crimes `` effective immediately . ''
chief O@@ ates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical mari@@ ju@@ ana gro@@ wers , and that they would still pursue drug traffi@@ ckers and dealers .
in northern Col@@ or@@ ado 's W@@ eld County , the district att@@ or@@ ney , K@@ en Bu@@ ck , represents a stricter view .
after the vote , he said his office would continue pursuing mari@@ ju@@ ana possession cases , mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment .
right now , 1@@ 19 people face charges of poss@@ essing two oun@@ ces or less of mari@@ ju@@ ana , though many are facing other charges .
`` Our office has an obligation to pro@@ secu@@ te off@@ enses that were crimes at the time they occurred , '' Mr. Bu@@ ck said in a statement .
the response has been complicated even in places like rural Mes@@ a County , where voters rejected the mari@@ ju@@ ana initiative .
the police in Grand Jun@@ ction , the coun@@ ty 's largest city , are no longer c@@ iting adults for possession of small amounts .
the coun@@ ty 's district att@@ or@@ ney , Pe@@ te Hau@@ tz@@ inger , supported that decision , but also decided not to dis@@ miss all of the pending possession cases .
`` I do not think I 'm wa@@ sting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes , '' he said .
although 55 percent of Col@@ or@@ ado voters supported the measure , bringing recreational mari@@ ju@@ ana into the fol@@ ds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple .
and the contradi@@ ctory reactions across the state lay bare a deep ambi@@ val@@ ence among local officials about the state 's big green experiment .
`` It 's a cultural barrier '' with district att@@ or@@ neys , said S@@ ean Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , a Den@@ ver lawyer who represents mari@@ ju@@ ana defen@@ dants and is a local sp@@ ok@@ es@@ man for the National Organization for the Reform of Mari@@ ju@@ ana La@@ ws .
`` Th@@ ey spent so much of their lives prosec@@ uting people that they still do n't really accept that this is legal , '' he said .
as the first states to treat small amounts of mari@@ ju@@ ana like alcohol , Col@@ or@@ ado and Washington are po@@ ised to become national test cases for drug leg@@ alization .
as advocates and state officials plan for a new fron@@ tier of leg@@ alized sales , they are also anxi@@ ously awaiting direction from the federal government , which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of mari@@ ju@@ ana as federal crimes .
advocates for leg@@ alized mari@@ ju@@ ana are hoping the Justice Department yiel@@ ds .
despite some high = profile arre@@ sts of medical mari@@ ju@@ ana patients and s@@ ellers , the federal government has mostly allowed medical mari@@ ju@@ ana businesses to operate in Col@@ or@@ ado , Washington and 16 other states .
while drug agents will probably not beat down doors to sei@@ ze a small bag of the drug , they are likely to bal@@ k at allowing the state = regulated recreational mari@@ ju@@ ana shops allowed under the new laws , said Kev@@ in A. Sa@@ bet , a former drug policy advis@@ er in the Obama administration .
several cities in Col@@ or@@ ado are not waiting for federal authorities to act .
even before Ele@@ ction Day , some local governments approved mor@@ atori@@ ums on any new mari@@ ju@@ ana shops , even though it will be about a year before any can open .
last week , the western city of Mon@@ tro@@ se took up a six = month ban , and is likely to pass it next week .
`` We do n't want to be put in a position where we license somebody and then have a big federal issue , '' said Bo@@ b Nichol@@ son , a City Council member .
our community voted against this amendment .
we ' re looking at what the community voted for ver@@ sus what the state voted for .
there 's an aw@@ ful lot of questions .
Pet@@ ron@@ ella W@@ y@@ att : I was bul@@ lied out of Oxford for being a T@@ ory
it is not just today 's university students who are attacked for their views
I ca n't remember a time when I did n't dream of winning a place at Oxford University .
both my father and my el@@ der brother had been at what I imag@@ ined was the world 's greatest seat of learning , a modern = day wine = b@@ lus@@ hed Greek sym@@ posi@@ um encouraging the dual pillars of civilisation , free thinking and tolerance .
yet , within two weeks of taking up my place at Wor@@ c@@ ester College in the late Ei@@ gh@@ ties to read history , I 'd packed my bags , pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ating the first scandal of my life .
my father broke down and cri@@ ed .
friends were ba@@ ff@@ led .
the E@@ ven@@ ing Standard di@@ ary claimed I 'd qu@@ it because I objec@@ ted to fellow under@@ gradu@@ ates having sex in the room next to mine .
the writer A N Wil@@ son announced wag@@ g@@ ish@@ ly that I 'd depar@@ ted because I was forced to drink out of chi@@ pped mu@@ gs .
the truth was less dro@@ ll .
I ran away .
yes , ran , because I had been subject to systematic bul@@ lying and intim@@ id@@ ation .
not on account of my rather ou@@ tr@@ é name , or the fact that I came from a private school .
I was per@@ sec@@ uted for one reason only , and in this cra@@ dle of supposed en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment it was both big@@ o@@ ted and bar@@ b@@ ari@@ c : my father , the late Woo@@ d@@ row W@@ y@@ att , was a high = profile advis@@ er to Mar@@ gare@@ t Th@@ at@@ cher and I was a Con@@ servative suppor@@ ter .
why bring this up now , you might ask .
well , recent reports suggest that a new generation of Ri@@ ght = of = centre students are suffering a similar persecution .
such is the institution@@ alised and increasing hat@@ red of T@@ ory students at Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same equal = rights protection as ga@@ ys , disabled people and ethnic minorities .
conservative members of Cor@@ p@@ us Christ@@ i College 's junior common room ( J@@ CR ) claim they are `` often actively isolated , personally attacked and made to feel un@@ welcome '' because of their political views .
they want to create a post on the college 's equal opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be aired freely .
their situation was n't helped by a recent BBC T@@ wo documentary , W@@ onder@@ land : young , B@@ right and on the Ri@@ ght , about student politics , which portra@@ yed T@@ ories as od@@ d@@ balls and neo = Naz@@ is .
it featured graduate Jo@@ e Co@@ o@@ ke , former president of the Oxford University Con@@ servative Association ( O@@ UC@@ A ) , travelling in a Rol@@ ls = Ro@@ y@@ ce , sporting a silver suit and silver = t@@ opp@@ ed cane .
at other universities , Con@@ servative students say they are being treated as `` scap@@ e@@ go@@ ats '' for the introduction of higher tu@@ ition fees . "
Lu@@ ke Black , 20 , vice = president of Not@@ t@@ ingham University Con@@ servative Association , told a Sunday newspaper that " there is a growing Left = wing bi@@ as at universities .
people assume we are like the Bul@@ ling@@ don Club without meeting us . "
Sam@@ uel Rober@@ ts , 21 , a history student at Cor@@ p@@ us Christ@@ i , who proposed the motion for greater protection , says such a climate is `` un@@ comfortable , '' while Ste@@ phan@@ ie Cher@@ ill , 19 , president elect of O@@ UC@@ A , says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of J@@ CR members towards people who are Ri@@ ght of centre .
`` This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion , as well as to the welfare of members , '' she says .
I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at Oxford .
I had gone up in September 1986 , a cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ingly sh@@ y 18 = year = old .
hat@@ red of the Con@@ servative Party was at its most f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le .
the year before , the university had voted to refuse Mar@@ gare@@ t Th@@ at@@ cher - a former student - an hon@@ or@@ ary degree , because of cuts in higher education funding .
the atmosphere would have made a Stal@@ in@@ ist sh@@ u@@ d@@ der with ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion .
during the first few days of fresh@@ ers " week , when new students soci@@ alise with each other and the d@@ ons , I had a taste of the wor@@ m@@ wood that was to come .
I was to find that the d@@ ons not only con@@ ni@@ ved in the ta@@ un@@ ting of T@@ ory under@@ gradu@@ ates but took part with re@@ lish .
the politics of the min@@ ers " strike , priv@@ atis@@ ation and the government 's opposition to sanctions against apar@@ thei@@ d South Africa were brought into the wood = pan@@ elled rooms of the tut@@ orial .
my first one involved transl@@ ating 18th = century French texts into English , and I was un@@ prepared for what followed .
`` Mis@@ s W@@ y@@ att , '' said the don , Harry P@@ itt ( now dec@@ e@@ ased ) , `` please translate the first paragraph . ''
I st@@ umb@@ led over it .
a small man with a face like cake bat@@ ter , P@@ itt was big on bi@@ le .
`` Do Th@@ at@@ cher@@ ites refuse to learn French or are they just st@@ up@@ id ? '' he demanded .
the other under@@ gradu@@ ates gi@@ gg@@ led .
te@@ ars pri@@ cked the back of my eyes .
`` I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time - that is , if you ' re not too busy soci@@ alising , '' P@@ itt sn@@ ar@@ led .
I wal@@ ked back to my rooms a dis@@ con@@ sol@@ ate figure .
at dinner in college that evening I sat by myself ; then I felt a light tap on my shoulder .
it was a second = year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the O@@ UC@@ A .
`` I know who you are , '' he said kindly .
I 'm afraid it 's like that .
anyone susp@@ ected of being a T@@ ory is picked on .
it 's bad enough for me , but they know your father is close to Mar@@ gare@@ t Th@@ at@@ cher , so it will be worse for you .
most T@@ ory fresh@@ ers pre@@ tend they ' re Labour .
later , at a local pu@@ b , I cra@@ ven@@ ly attempted to dis@@ simul@@ ate .
I insi@@ sted that I did n't agree with everything Mrs Th@@ at@@ cher said .
this plo@@ y proved un@@ successful .
a first year PPE student , who , ir@@ on@@ ically , had been to E@@ ton , said : `` You ' re the daughter of a fasc@@ ist p@@ ig . ''
you ' re contam@@ inated .
other students took up the refra@@ in .
I was per@@ ver@@ ted , dirty .
`` How do T@@ ories have sex ? '' one asked .
they beat each other , do n't they ?
I felt the way homo@@ sexu@@ als must have felt before the liberal legislation of the Si@@ x@@ ties .
would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford ?
would I be forced to meet like = minded people only after dark ?
would I have to turn to Labour and sup@@ press my natural inc@@ lin@@ ations ?
the three years before me stret@@ ched out as a pur@@ g@@ atory of o@@ stra@@ c@@ ism and isolation .
the only openly T@@ ory don was Nor@@ man St@@ one , Professor of Modern History , who was based at my college .
he was h@@ ated for being not only a Con@@ servative but a foreign policy advis@@ er to Th@@ at@@ cher and one of her speech writers .
he was hardly ever there .
he lo@@ ath@@ ed the place as provin@@ cial and pet@@ ty , and for its adher@@ ence to the Mar@@ x@@ ist = determin@@ ist view of history .
in 1997 he took up a prof@@ ess@@ or@@ ship at the University of Bil@@ k@@ ent , in Ankara , Turkey .
`` You wo n't be happy here , '' he told me .
I began comm@@ uting from Oxford to my parents " house in London , finding refu@@ ge with my more open = minded metro@@ politan friends and family .
I told my father I h@@ ated Oxford and why .
he was incre@@ dul@@ ous .
during his time there in the For@@ ties , all political views had been accepted .
`` Bu@@ t it 's the best place in the world , '' he said pa@@ the@@ tically .
they would n't do that , not among my dre@@ aming spi@@ res .
even my Communist friends always had imp@@ ec@@ cable man@@ ners .
his r@@ he@@ um@@ y eyes began to clou@@ d .
give it a chance .
I 'm sure it 's all just a te@@ ase .
it would break my heart if you left .
exhau@@ sted by my frequent trips to London , my emotional resistance was deterior@@ ating .
a male friend of mine , also a T@@ ory suppor@@ ter , had succ@@ um@@ bed to pressure and ren@@ oun@@ ced his cre@@ ed .
during a tut@@ orial the following week , when another history don had suggested , in complete seri@@ ousness , that I was an `` enemy of the people , '' I decided to do the same .
in@@ war@@ dly b@@ lus@@ hing with shame , I admitted to being `` bra@@ in@@ wash@@ ed by my parents '' and called them `` old fo@@ ols . ''
the resp@@ ite was short .
it was my father who dro@@ ve the nail into the co@@ ff@@ in of my Oxford career .
at the time , he wrote two columns in the Mur@@ doch press each week .
my door was locked .
I co@@ wer@@ ed inside , and after five minutes , my pursu@@ ers gave up .
when they left , I packed a su@@ it@@ case and caught the first train to London .
I never went back .
you may call me a s@@ ni@@ v@@ elling wi@@ mp .
but no 18 = year = old should be subject to such intim@@ id@@ ation and vit@@ ri@@ ol in an educational institution .
even more tragic is that it was Oxford , which not only produced 14 T@@ ory prime ministers , but , to this day , hi@@ des behind an ill = deser@@ ved reputation for equality and freedom of thought .
`` Val@@ entino pre@@ fers elegance to not@@ ori@@ ety ''
on the occasion of the `` Val@@ entino : master of Cou@@ ture , '' an exhibition that opened this week in London , AB@@ C speaks with Nat@@ y Ab@@ as@@ cal , Fi@@ ona Th@@ y@@ ssen = Bor@@ ne@@ mis@@ za and other of the Italian designer 's famous clients .
Som@@ er@@ set House , former home of Queen Eli@@ za@@ beth I of England , is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Val@@ entino Gar@@ av@@ ani exhibition .
during the inau@@ gu@@ ration of `` Val@@ entino : master of Cou@@ ture , '' the designer acknowledged a retro@@ spective a@@ pothe@@ o@@ sis that brings together over 130 cou@@ ture go@@ wns created by his fashion house over the past 50 years .
`` I love this palace '' he says , in his un@@ mistak@@ able Italian acc@@ ent .
this exhibition is the cul@@ min@@ ation of a story whose only pro@@ tagon@@ ist is `` sig@@ nor@@ e '' Gar@@ av@@ ani , although it could not have been written without his distinguished clients .
Val@@ entino has always been fascin@@ ated by the ra@@ re@@ fied and distant world of the no@@ bility .
in the first room of the exhibition , open until March 3 , there are a number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of ari@@ sto@@ cracy , from Princ@@ ess S@@ ali@@ ma@@ h A@@ ga Kh@@ an , Lord Snow@@ don , Princ@@ ess Marie = Ch@@ ant@@ al of Greece to Mar@@ gare@@ t of England .
Val@@ entino exhi@@ bits these personal memories as if they were trop@@ hi@@ es of his social as@@ cent from hum@@ ble cou@@ tur@@ ier in Vo@@ gh@@ era , northern Italy , to i@@ do@@ l of the international jet = set .
there is nothing wrong with lo@@ ving ro@@ y@@ alty .
`` At least they do n't drop cigare@@ tte ends on your magnificent car@@ pet , like some beautiful pop music celeb@@ ri@@ ties do , '' says Baroness Fi@@ ona Th@@ y@@ ssen = Bor@@ ne@@ mis@@ za .
in the ' 6@@ 0s and ' 7@@ 0s , we both lived in the Alps and were good friends .
Val@@ entino is a spectacular host whose enter@@ tains with gener@@ osity and elegance .
`` We all loved being invited to his chal@@ et in G@@ sta@@ ad '' says `` Hein@@ i '' Th@@ y@@ ssen 's ex = wife , a close friend of forgotten beau@@ ties such as Ma@@ rel@@ la A@@ gn@@ elli and Eu@@ gen@@ ie Ni@@ arch@@ os .
Val@@ entino has always preferred elegance to not@@ ori@@ ety .
and yet , he is a star .
Val@@ eria Maz@@ za , wearing a Val@@ entino .
the Argent@@ ine model Val@@ eria Maz@@ za also rec@@ alls the cou@@ tur@@ ier 's char@@ is@@ ma .
many years ago , after a fashion show in Piazza di Sp@@ agna in Rome , we went for dinner at his flat .
there were twenty of us , including Sharon St@@ one and John Kenne@@ dy J@@ r .
you could see and feel his `` spirit '' in every detail of the flat and its decor , the food and the music .
`` All the guests were made to feel important and loved '' rec@@ alls the top model , who started working with him during Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture We@@ ek Paris , in 1995 .
`` H@@ is designs are works of art and so never go out of fashion '' she concludes .
no@@ bility par@@ ade
Gar@@ av@@ ani 's life is not a story of ob@@ session , but of well reciproc@@ ated love .
he lo@@ ves well = educated people who come from good back@@ grounds , and they love him .
one of the Som@@ er@@ set House galleries has been transformed into a gl@@ amor@@ ous , six@@ ty = foot long cat@@ walk which offers a role re@@ versal : visitors take the place of the models and have to par@@ ade down the cat@@ walk while looking at a dream `` audience '' wearing Val@@ entino master@@ pieces , for example , the dress Jack@@ ie Kenne@@ dy chose for her wedding with A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le On@@ as@@ sis , the cost@@ ume Mon@@ ica Vit@@ ti wor@@ e in `` La Not@@ te '' and the w@@ ool and leather coat that belon@@ ged to Em@@ press Far@@ ah Di@@ ba .
in this crow@@ d of man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , names stand out such as Si@@ bil@@ la of Luxembourg , Gl@@ oria von Th@@ ur@@ n und Ta@@ xis , M@@ ette = Mar@@ it of Norway , Ros@@ ario of Bulgaria and Sofia of Hab@@ sburg .
Nat@@ y Ab@@ as@@ cal and the designer , in 2006
many of these clients say your first Val@@ entino is like your first love , `` impossible to forget . ''
I remember it perfectly .
it was a pair of tro@@ users , a shirt , a `` gi@@ let '' wa@@ ist@@ coat and jack@@ et from the 1971 = 1972 autumn = winter collection .
`` It was a gift he gave me '' says Nat@@ y Ab@@ as@@ cal , one of the designer 's m@@ uses .
`` I prefer him to other designers because of his femin@@ inity , his great love of women , and because he en@@ han@@ ces our beauty '' added the former Du@@ ch@@ ess of Feri@@ a .
I love the colours he uses , they really stand out and `` lend themselves '' to your face .
their propor@@ tions are perfect .
the prin@@ c@@ ess and fashion advis@@ or Patri@@ cia della Giov@@ amp@@ a@@ ola d ' Ar@@ en@@ berg also re@@ members the first time she wor@@ e a Val@@ entino .
as a teen@@ ager living in Italy , I dre@@ amed of reaching the age when I 'd have the chance to wear one of his evening go@@ wns ...
my time finally came in the late ' 9@@ 0s .
I bought my first Val@@ entino dress to wear at a party in the castle belonging to my c@@ ous@@ in , Prince E@@ dou@@ ard de Lig@@ ne .
it was a red dress , with a fri@@ l@@ ly sk@@ ir@@ t , dra@@ ped `` cor@@ sage '' and a stra@@ pl@@ ess ne@@ ck@@ line .
`` It was a dream come true '' says Princ@@ ess D ' Ar@@ en@@ berg , the wi@@ dow of Ro@@ dri@@ go d ' Ar@@ en@@ berg .
`` Val@@ entino is in@@ different to fashion , his ob@@ session is tim@@ eless '' says this Italian ari@@ sto@@ crat who lives between Paris , New York and Buenos Aires .
Princ@@ ess D ' Ar@@ en@@ berg looks after her cou@@ tur@@ ier go@@ wns with `` the utmost care ... because a dress not just a dress , it 's also the many memories that go with it . ''
the `` king '' of fashion
the `` grand fin@@ ale '' of the Som@@ er@@ set House exhibition is Marie = Ch@@ ant@@ al Mil@@ ler 's wedding dress from her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995 .
it took four months ' work and 25 `` girls '' ( as the designer calls his seam@@ stresses ) to create the pe@@ ar@@ l = en@@ cru@@ sted , i@@ vor@@ y = coloured sil@@ k go@@ wn with twelve different types of l@@ ace and a train four and a half metres long .
according to journalist Su@@ zy Men@@ kes , the leading authority of the specialist press , that dress represents a high fashion mile@@ stone of the late 20th century , `` the return of high society clients . ''
da@@ zz@@ led for years with the `` sa@@ voir = ê@@ tre '' of the elite , Val@@ entino is now its finest exp@@ on@@ ent .
Cav@@ ali@@ ere di Gran Cro@@ ce ( the highest = ranking distinction in Italy ) , Cav@@ ali@@ ere del La@@ vor@@ o , Comm@@ an@@ de@@ ur de L ' Or@@ dr@@ e des Arts et des Lett@@ res , and awarded the Legi@@ on of Hon@@ our , Gar@@ av@@ ani accum@@ ul@@ ates as many hon@@ ours as any of his clients ' hus@@ bands .
`` I 've always been struck by his refined and calm manner , and his ne@@ at and perfect appearance '' acknowled@@ ges D ' Ar@@ en@@ berg .
the last time I saw him was a month ago at a g@@ ala dinner at the Or@@ say Museum .
he was on the table of Coun@@ t@@ ess J@@ acqu@@ el@@ ine de Ri@@ bes , a great friend of mine .
`` He was imm@@ ac@@ ulate , time stands still for him . ''
if a prin@@ c@@ ess says that ...
the har@@ dest job in the world : the human mul@@ es of Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en
for four euros , the Indones@@ ian volcan@@ o por@@ ters risk life and lim@@ b carrying 70 ki@@ los of sul@@ ph@@ ur along steep stone paths .
there are people for whom work is hell , and others who - literally - work in hell .
this is the case of An@@ to Wi@@ ja@@ ya , one of the 400 min@@ ers who make their living taking sul@@ ph@@ ur from the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en volcan@@ o , east of the Indones@@ ian island of Java .
to do so , he has to desc@@ end every day to the bottom of the cr@@ ater , where the sul@@ ph@@ u@@ rous gas eman@@ ating from the bo@@ wels of the earth soli@@ di@@ fies on contact with air .
after breaking off large sul@@ ph@@ ur rocks , which in total can wei@@ gh up to 70 ki@@ los , he carries them in two b@@ am@@ bo@@ o bas@@ k@@ ets on his shoul@@ ders along the steep stone paths .
it is only 250 metres to the top of the volcan@@ o , which rises to 2,@@ 3@@ 86 metres above sea level , but the exhau@@ sted por@@ ters take over 40 minutes to get there , at sn@@ ail 's pace , keeping their balance and measuring their steps carefully to avoid sli@@ pping and falling over the pre@@ cip@@ ice .
they know that one sli@@ p could cost them their lives , as happened to a French tourist who pl@@ ung@@ ed to her death a few years ago on the hazardous Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en cli@@ ffs .
the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en min@@ ers are paid 5 euro c@@ ents for each kil@@ o of sul@@ ph@@ ur removed .
once at the top , they make their way past the tourists who photogra@@ ph them like cir@@ cus mon@@ keys and then , lug@@ ging their heavy bas@@ k@@ ets , they walk three kilometres to the sc@@ ales installed by a mining company a little further down , 1,@@ 8@@ 50 metres above sea level .
this is PT N@@ gri@@ mb@@ i C@@ and@@ i , a company which , since 1960 , has been explo@@ iting the volcan@@ o , and quite literally its workers , whom it pays 6@@ 62 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 5 euro c@@ ents ) per kil@@ o of sul@@ ph@@ ur .
it then s@@ ells the sul@@ ph@@ ur for 10,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 83 c@@ ents ) to the pet@@ ro@@ chemical industry , as the mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used in the manufacture of matches , fire@@ works , cosme@@ tics , dynam@@ ite and even for wh@@ it@@ ening sugar .
`` We generally carry 70 ki@@ los , so we get about 4@@ 6@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 3.@@ 8 euros ) a trip '' explains An@@ to , who usually make three trips a day .
each one takes three hours and you end up exhau@@ sted , but it means he gets 13@@ 8@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 11.@@ 5 euros ) at the end of the day .
although it seems a pit@@ tance for such an in@@ human effort , it is three times what he would earn in the field .
`` Min@@ ers ' wages are very high here , whereas coffee har@@ vest@@ ing is paid 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 1.2 euros ) a day and the average monthly wage is two million ru@@ pe@@ es ( 16@@ 7 euros ) '' explains the por@@ ter , who previously worked as a mas@@ on in the island resort of Bali .
there , his wage was 7@@ 5@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 6.@@ 2 euros ) a day and the work was not as hard , but An@@ to has returned with his family to B@@ any@@ u@@ wan@@ gi , a village near the volcan@@ o , for a comp@@ elling reason which , in Indonesia , is as over@@ riding as the sul@@ ph@@ ur : `` I married a girl from Bali , where they are Hin@@ du , and I 've brought her to Java to convert to Islam . ''
An@@ to has as@@ th@@ ma , he has difficulty brea@@ thing , cou@@ gh@@ s constantly and his eyes are ir@@ rit@@ ated by the toxic gases .
at 27 years old , An@@ to has been ris@@ king his life for three years in the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en volcan@@ o , and the sul@@ ph@@ ur has already begun to take its toll on him , even though he covers his face with special mask and go@@ gg@@ les .
he has as@@ th@@ ma , he has difficulty brea@@ thing , cou@@ gh@@ s constantly and his eyes are ir@@ rit@@ ated by the toxic gases from the volcan@@ o .
this is the price you have to pay to realise your dreams .
`` I 'll go on working two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French '' he vo@@ ws in more than acceptable English .
punished for life , this pleasant , intelligent young man could be a tour guide , wa@@ iter or hotel recep@@ tion@@ ist , but instead he does the work of a mu@@ le .
sharing a fil@@ thy wooden hu@@ t with other por@@ ters , he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sul@@ ph@@ ur does n't stop flo@@ wing at night , when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and it glo@@ ws in the dark .
def@@ ying the sha@@ dows , An@@ to desc@@ ends the cr@@ ater and lights the path with a small tor@@ ch attached to the hel@@ met he bought with his money .
some 400 por@@ ters carry sul@@ ph@@ ur bas@@ k@@ ets on their shoul@@ ders from the cr@@ ater .
despite their huge profits , the mining company has not mechan@@ ised the sul@@ ph@@ ur extra@@ ction process to save costs , nor has it provided any equipment for the por@@ ters , who work for themselves and by the kil@@ o .
in fact , they do not even see any of the 30@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ e ( 2.5 euro ) per camera sur@@ charge that , on top of the 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ e ( 1.2 euro ) entrance fee , the guards of this natural reserve charge to tourists who come to photogra@@ ph the volcan@@ o and their human mul@@ es .
`` This work is for animals , not people '' protests Mad@@ rus@@ in , a bur@@ ly 42 = year por@@ ter who has been working at Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en for three decades , since leaving school .
he can lift up to 110 ki@@ los , ensuring that he will go on working `` all he can '' because he needs the money to educ@@ ate his three children , aged between 18 [ months ? ] and 10 years old .
I wo n't reti@@ re , I 'll die here because the volcan@@ o has been my whole life .
although the sul@@ ph@@ ur bur@@ ns your thro@@ at and st@@ ings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and tra@@ ps the min@@ ers in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcan@@ o , they are so har@@ dy that no = one compla@@ ins of serious ill@@ nesses ... apart , of course , from their common resp@@ ir@@ atory problems , o@@ ste@@ o@@ ar@@ th@@ riti@@ s , kne@@ e pain and so@@ res on the shoul@@ ders , which have been mis@@ sha@@ pen by the weight of the bas@@ k@@ ets .
bal@@ ancing the bas@@ ket on his back , Un@@ a@@ ini@@ k can only carry 50 ki@@ los now he is 53 years old .
every day , he and his fellow workers break off 15 tonnes of sul@@ ph@@ ur from the volcan@@ o , which three lor@@ ries move to the ware@@ house in Tam@@ ans@@ ari , 18 kilometres away along a go@@ at path that passes through sc@@ rub@@ land .
`` I wo n't reti@@ re , I 'll die here because the volcan@@ o has been my whole life '' says Un@@ a@@ ini@@ k , opening a mouth full of gaps where teeth use to be .
the oldest of his five children , 30 years old , also works carrying sul@@ ph@@ ur .
time passes , but poverty perpet@@ u@@ ates from generation to generation in one of the har@@ dest jobs in the world : the one done by human mul@@ es in the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en volcan@@ o .

it may seem unlikely that these ver@@ ses are part of an adver@@ t for min@@ t swe@@ ets , but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went vi@@ ral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year .
the phra@@ ses are part of a ra@@ p and make use of local references such as `` L@@ et 's put a ba@@ o ( bu@@ n ) in the oven '' to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore .
the advertising company that made the video , BB@@ H , is hope@@ ful that the adverti@@ sement will manage to focus attention to the problem in a fun way .
its creative director , Dou@@ glas Ham@@ il@@ ton , says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their `` national duty . ''
it 's purely an Internet thing , so we had to make it fun and am@@ using .
it 's the biggest problem facing this country .
we are the world 's worst at re@@ producing our own pro@@ gen@@ y , so we felt it was an issue we had to address .
we knew the Government had tried many things , like launching perf@@ umes with pher@@ om@@ ones or organising speed dating evenings .
many of these ideas may have been creative , but they did n't necessarily work .
so we thought : why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem , by compos@@ ing a ra@@ p ?
1.2 children
but the Singapore Government is not taking it so ligh@@ tly .
it sp@@ ends USD 1,@@ 300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children .
a government package for marri@@ ages and parents grants up to USD 15@@ ,000 per child , extends mat@@ ernity leave and distri@@ butes tax benefits .
but this has all had little effect .
Singapore is a rich , high technology city State in Sou@@ theast Asia , also known for the con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m of its leaders and its strict social controls .
the birth rate in Singapore , according to its national population division , currently stands at 1.2 children per woman .
the last time it was over 2 , known as the replacement rate , was in 1976 .
so why are Sing@@ apo@@ re@@ ans not having children ?
tan We@@ i M@@ ing , Director of Mar@@ ri@@ age and Family Policy of the National Pop@@ ulation Division , said that it is a result of `` better education '' and `` a wider range of career opportunities . ''
`` This has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities , beyond getting married and starting a family '' he explains .
these changes in social nor@@ ms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single , and dela@@ ying marriage and bir@@ ths , which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore .
meanwhile , an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created res@@ ent@@ ment among the local population .
in Singapore , there are websites where xen@@ ophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thin@@ ly dis@@ gu@@ ised , especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating .
increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why , last year , the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence .
since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem , with the highest taxes and le@@ vi@@ es for foreign workers .
unexpected consequences
while a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation 's economic growth , tax revenues , healthcare costs and immigration policies , in Singapore 's case there are also some unexpected consequences .
the Government is trying not to build so many small houses .
for example , it has started to influence the real estate sector .
its urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments , known as `` shoe boxes , '' which can be built in certain areas of the city .
these apartments have a surface of 46 square metres and have been very successful in terms of sales .
however , there is concern that they may promote a single = living lifestyle and disc@@ ou@@ rage developers who want to build large family houses .
but , L@@ im Y@@ e@@ w So@@ on , managing director of the real estate company EL Develop@@ ers , says his `` shoe boxes '' sell much faster than larger units .
they are more popular , in the sense that the units sell days , even weeks , faster than larger units .
this means they are much better for our cash flow .
however , he ad@@ mits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to developers , who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project .
too stressed
Singapore is a city State .
although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate , when talking to Sing@@ apo@@ re@@ ans working in the central financial district , it seems they will not have much impact .
`` People are very stressed , houses are expensive and so is education , so a lot of people are putting off having a family '' says a young executive .
other people can have children .
`` Bu@@ t , for me , it is important to have my own money and time '' says another young man of around 20 years old .
men and women alike mention their care@@ ers , stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children .
so , much as the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children , when it comes to bab@@ ies , the Sing@@ apo@@ re@@ ans have the last word .
what is private offline is private online
privacy .
according to the Spanish Royal Academy D@@ ic@@ tionary , it means the quality of private life or `` the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference . ''
what is privacy for an under 16 ?
how do you apply this definition to their daily life and social networks ?
do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by air@@ ing information over the Internet which they probably would not share offline ?
El@@ Peri@@ ó@@ di@@ co inter@@ viewed five children aged between ten and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users .
in four cases , they associated the term with `` something very much mine '' on a personal level , and `` in the user name and password '' when applied to social networks .
`` I would n't upload my deep@@ est secre@@ ts in a post '' says Jor@@ ge , aged ten , when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook , Twitter , Hot@@ mail and Windows Live Messenger , with which he has had accounts for two years .
`` Th@@ ey are very secret secre@@ ts , I 'll tell my mother , but not everybody '' he says .
on F@@ B I upload nice pictures or games .
and I have fun with people I know .
`` I would n't share a photo that is n't mine , or that belongs to somebody who 's doing something st@@ up@@ id '' he says .
the child recognises that it is bad to post ob@@ scene pictures of n@@ aked people , crimes , or write hum@@ ili@@ ating or aggressive comments .
Jor@@ ge says he knows the 35 friends he has on F@@ B and his nine follo@@ wers on Twitter .
most are rel@@ atives .
his mother is included , and she has the password to one of the accounts .
I opened Twitter to express myself and post interesting t@@ we@@ ets .
`` I do n't know if they answer me , I only upload them '' he adds .
`` Social networking is fun , I can talk quickly to rel@@ atives far away or my friends '' he says .
he does not hesitate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person .
nor would he take any notice of someone who recommends a stran@@ ger to him .
the case of Joseph , aged 14 , is different .
this teen@@ ager has accounts with Hot@@ mail , Facebook , My Space and As@@ k , and in the last case he ad@@ mits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list .
`` It does n't bo@@ ther me , because we have something in common , like music '' he says .
the boy says that no = one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number .
`` If they pres@@ su@@ red me or asked me for it , I 'd just delete them from my account '' he states .
Joseph became a follo@@ wer on As@@ k , after reading a recommendation on Twitter .
this teen@@ ager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cy@@ ber@@ bul@@ lying .
an acqu@@ ain@@ tance of a friend of mine was being p@@ est@@ ered on a social network .
they were threatening him and demanding money from him .
`` I never found out who it was '' he says .
the victim , according to José , did not close his account .
`` He just made it private . ''
he then explains a series of steps to configure the account safely .
unlike Jor@@ ge , this boy would upload photos of acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces in un@@ comfortable or embar@@ ras@@ sing situations .
I would do it if I did n't like somebody , or they made me want to do it .
`` Ho@@ wever , I know that 's cy@@ ber@@ bul@@ lying '' he ad@@ mits .
key questions
Mari@@ el@@ os Por@@ ras , an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning , believes that to guide children and teen@@ agers , they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform .
`` The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information , but with the appearance of these websites , the rules of the game changed '' he says .
Por@@ ras says the schol@@ ar Marc Pr@@ ens@@ ky , with a Master 's degree in Education from Y@@ ale University and author of the work Digital N@@ atives , Digital Imm@@ igrants , co@@ ined these terms to explain the phenomenon .
digital n@@ atives are those children and young people born with technology .
`` We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them , when we are still in fact learning '' he says .
he says that the issue is complex , `` because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to dis@@ close , publish or di@@ vul@@ ge , at an age at which mat@@ urity is not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to this . ''
`` Th@@ ey also have to be selec@@ tive when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands of friends , without thinking of the consequences '' he adds .
according to the specialist , the most effective way to teach children and teen@@ agers what privacy is , is through questions that make them think .
`` T@@ elling them not to do it is no good '' he adds .
Por@@ ras then lists some options : there are things you would n't tell a stran@@ ger , so why do it online ?
or , would you like a friend to publish a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend ?
do you know what others publish about you ?
when tag@@ ging party photos , did you ask the other people 's permission to tag them ?
and one more question : does everyone need to know what you ' re doing all the time ?
another point is to make them see that they must be@@ have online as they do offline .
the rules are the same .
`` Out@@ side the Internet , people act with respect , mor@@ ality and other principles , so they should act the same way on social networks '' he says .
monitoring
Stu@@ art Gu@@ ard , a university professor , primary school teacher and educational consul@@ tant , says it is essential for parents to read social networks ' policies thoroughly .
by understanding all the clauses , they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account .
`` For example , the age at which you are allowed to share or publish '' he says .
according to Guar@@ dia , it is important to remind children the `` do n't talk to stran@@ gers '' lesson .
UN@@ AS@@ UR Summit clo@@ ses without making public the Lim@@ a Declaration
the Si@@ x@@ th Pre@@ sidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations ( Un@@ asur ) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lim@@ a Declaration , previously announced and theore@@ tically signed by the seven atten@@ de@@ e leaders .
EF@@ E repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Si@@ x@@ th UN@@ AS@@ UR Meeting of Heads of State and Government , but Pre@@ sidential and Chancell@@ ery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed , but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Peru@@ vian Government website .
when asked about the text , they pointed out that the content had been dis@@ closed by Peru@@ vian President , Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala , during a brief statement to the press .
journalists ' access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times .
during the summit , in the press room , only video was aired , with no sound , showing the presidential meeting with the message `` closed session , audio restricted . ''
the little information that circul@@ ated among re@@ por@@ ters was given by the press sp@@ ok@@ es@@ men of some of the UN@@ AS@@ UR governments attending the meeting , but not the Peru@@ vian Government .
the only document released during the summit was the list of attending pre@@ sidents , which an@@ gered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media , who asked for more details .
the Peru@@ vian President then sent an email to the media with the `` final statement '' of the summit , but this was Hum@@ ala 's statement , and not the official document that closed the summit .
last October , Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American = Arab Coun@@ tries ( A@@ spa ) , and this time , despite repeated requests from the press , the previously announced Lim@@ a Declaration was again not made public .
the A@@ spa official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday .
at both international events , the Peru@@ vian authorities were at pa@@ ins to ensure that there were broadcasting systems assured for all the journalists , but limited the obtaining of information to a maximum .
the summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court to adju@@ dic@@ ate a border dispute between the two countries .
the Presidents of Peru , Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala , and Chile , Sebas@@ ti@@ án Pi@@ ñ@@ era , met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice ( IC@@ J ) , which on Monday , at The Hague , will start to hear the arguments of both parties , in the law@@ suit Lim@@ a has filed against Santiago .
`` We will o@@ bey and execute the order that currently defines the differences we are bringing before this international court '' said Hum@@ ala , together with his Chi@@ lean counter@@ part .
`` Chile has been , is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes , treaties and international courts '' added Pi@@ ñ@@ era , gre@@ eting Hum@@ ala with a hand@@ sha@@ ke , alongside the flags of the two countries .
confirmation of both pre@@ sidents that they would submit to the IC@@ J came after Colombia this week denoun@@ ced the Bo@@ go@@ t@@ á Pact , whereby it accepted to submit to the jud@@ gement of this international court , following a decision on its maritime bound@@ ary with Nic@@ ar@@ agua which it regarded as seriously fla@@ wed .
the summit was held with the absence of the Presidents of Brazil , D@@ il@@ ma R@@ ous@@ se@@ ff ; Venezuela , Hu@@ go Cha@@ vez ; Boli@@ via , E@@ vo Mor@@ ales ; and Argentina , Crist@@ ina Kir@@ chner .
Par@@ agu@@ ay , which was suspended by UN@@ AS@@ UR in 2011 after the dis@@ mis@@ sal of former President Fern@@ ando Lu@@ go , was not involved in the meeting .
host President Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala was responsible for opening the session in the morning and closing the summit , just after noon in Lim@@ a .
the President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid down for 31 projects between the South American countries , for a total of 17 billion dollars of investments .
among the resolutions adopted , it was mentioned that UN@@ AS@@ UR countries will take `` important steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship , for which residence agreements are being extended . ''
he reported that actions are being implemented to improve `` cooperation in the fight against in@@ security and transnational organised crime , actions to make medic@@ ation more accessible , low = cost Internet access in all areas of South America , and to deal jointly and efficiently with risks of natural disasters . ''
with Europe in crisis , `` economic consolidation ( in Latin America ) should not have a trium@@ p@@ ha@@ list attitude but should serve to expand its productive mat@@ rix and gli@@ mp@@ se a better future for its people '' Hum@@ ala added .
`` We decided to focus on a group of 31 flag@@ ship projects that will improve connection among areas of South America , especially in rural and border areas ... un@@ iting our countries and creating new economic networks '' said the Peru@@ vian President in a message read out .
among these projects , he mentioned that five are in Peru and are located in the trans@@ verse a@@ xes of its territory , between the coast and Brazil , and two focus on increased connection with Ecu@@ ador , although he gave no further details .
also , the final document mentioned the political situation in Par@@ agu@@ ay .
`` We hope the electoral process in that country serves to rein@@ corporate it in the Union of South American Nations , '' from which it is currently excluded .
the need for Latin America to remain a prosper@@ ous , peaceful and integrated nation , with good neighbour@@ ly relations , was another issue highlighted by the summit .
in this sense , the President of Colombia , Juan Manuel San@@ tos , said before attending the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counter@@ part from Nic@@ ar@@ agua , Daniel Or@@ te@@ ga , on Saturday in Mexico , to respec@@ t@@ fully discuss the maritime dispute after the failure of the IC@@ J , ques@@ tioned by Bo@@ go@@ ta .
`` The day after tomorrow ( Saturday ) I might have a meeting with President Daniel Or@@ te@@ ga '' San@@ tos said .
`` We will review all these paths , [ which ] are not exclusive , and the treaty with Nic@@ ar@@ agua will require a conversation with Nic@@ ar@@ agua '' he emphasised .
`` With President Or@@ te@@ ga , I hope I can say that we handle this in the most civili@@ sed and respec@@ t@@ ful manner possible '' said San@@ tos .
San@@ tos and Or@@ te@@ ga are due to meet on Saturday in Mexico , where they expect to attend the inau@@ gu@@ ration of the country 's new President , En@@ ri@@ que Pe@@ ña Nie@@ to .
also , as part of the summit , the blo@@ c 's foreign defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region .
Argentina , Boli@@ via , Colombia , Ecu@@ ador , Peru , Brazil , Uru@@ gu@@ ay , Venezuela , Chile , Gu@@ y@@ ana , Sur@@ in@@ am and Par@@ agu@@ ay make up UN@@ AS@@ UR , although the latter is currently suspended .
Peru has the pro tempor@@ e presidency of the regional blo@@ c .
`` South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship '' says Raf@@ ael Cor@@ rea
the President of Ecu@@ ador , Raf@@ ael Cor@@ rea , said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that `` South America , in this case , must learn from Europe . ''
Cor@@ rea , who took part in the Elev@@ enth Pre@@ sidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations ( UN@@ AS@@ UR ) held in Lim@@ a , told Peru 's state television that Europeans `` killed one another in the Second World War '' and other conflicts , `` but are now practically one country . ''
to this end , he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by member countries of UN@@ AS@@ UR .
`` We have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country , as is already the situation with members of the An@@ de@@ an Community . however , there are still re@@ ac@@ tionary sectors that want us to return to the past '' he said .
the Ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an President was also in favour of the restructuring of the Organisation of American States ( O@@ AS ) under the pre@@ mise of reducing the influence of the An@@ gl@@ o = Sax@@ on states and taking into account those who have signed the Pact of San José on human rights .
those who speak with authority never commit to anything , whereas we South Americans sign everything .
`` It is in@@ comprehensible that the In@@ ter = American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding '' he said referring to Ecu@@ ador giving political asylum to Wiki@@ Le@@ aks founder Ju@@ lian Ass@@ ange .
Cor@@ rea said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not betra@@ yed his principles , but has respected his `` deep democratic and human rights values . ''
he added that , at the time , `` he had reasonable suspici@@ on that Ass@@ ange would be ex@@ tradi@@ ted to another country and that his case would not be respected . ''
additionally , he criticised the Swedish courts for demanding that he be subject to ques@@ tioning for an alleged sexual off@@ ence in his country , when `` Swedish legislation itself dict@@ ates that he can be ques@@ tioned via vide@@ o@@ conference , which could be done from the Ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an E@@ mb@@ ass@@ y in London . ''
Cor@@ rea said that there is a risk of deterioration of Ass@@ ange 's physical and mental health .
`` I have not spoken to him since he was at our em@@ bass@@ y , but the amb@@ ass@@ ador informed me that he had a minor lung problem , nothing serious '' said the Ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an President .
what there is , is the danger that his physical and mental health may deterior@@ ate due to being locked in a small space without any outdoor exercise .
`` T@@ hat would complic@@ ate the health of any person '' he added .
Cor@@ rea said that the solution to the asylum granted to Ass@@ ange in June by the Ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an E@@ mb@@ ass@@ y , in London , through the issue of a safe = conduct pass that permits travel to Ecu@@ ador , is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , and stressed that there have been talks with London to seek a solution to the imprison@@ ment of the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks founder .
we do not negotiate with human rights , we do not use that word in this case , but there have been ongoing discussions .
`` The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , because Ass@@ ange 's lawyer , Bal@@ ta@@ z@@ ar Gar@@ zon , is handling a series of cases in different European courts '' he said .
and he felt that `` if Britain says no to the safe = conduct pass , it 's over . ''
and if Sweden , as its legislation perfectly well allows it to do , and as it has done in other cases , questions Mr Ass@@ ange at the E@@ mb@@ ass@@ y of Ecu@@ ador in London , or inter@@ ro@@ gates him via Skype tomorrow , this problem is over .
Cor@@ rea took the opportunity to reas@@ sert himself as a def@@ ender of freedom of the press and stated that what he does not toler@@ ate is `` the medi@@ oc@@ r@@ ity , dish@@ on@@ est@@ y and lies that undermine the freedom of expression . ''
`` The greatest enemies of the press freedom are not evil and wick@@ ed politicians , but bad journalists depending on profit , black@@ mail and ex@@ tor@@ tion '' he said .
in that regard , he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journalists , `` or the ban@@ kers or bour@@ geo@@ is and he@@ gemon@@ ic countries that domin@@ ate Ecu@@ ador '' and said that , if re = elected , he will `` step up the revolution to continue on the same path and in the right direction . ''
Cor@@ rea also supported the decision to maintain the ve@@ to on Par@@ agu@@ ay in UN@@ AS@@ UR , at least until their next elections , argu@@ ing that the body `` must be firm and not toler@@ ate opport@@ un@@ ism and a coup mas@@ ked with leg@@ ality '' because this will in fact `` destroy the legitimacy of Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an democracy . ''
the Ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an President also considered the `` perfectly per@@ tin@@ ent '' desire of his Colom@@ bian counter@@ part , Juan Manuel San@@ tos , to now negotiate with Nic@@ ar@@ agua the maritime bound@@ ary between the two countries , after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague , in favour Nic@@ ar@@ agu@@ an maritime sovereignty .
for now that ruling is not being followed .
it is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one .
conflict is inevitable , but must be overcome by the desire to walk together .
they need to be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward .
additionally , he tru@@ sted in a sound conclusion to the maritime bound@@ ary dispute oppos@@ ing Peru and Chile in the same court and said that `` it is right for Latin America to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing , however hard it may be . ''
with reference to the possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecu@@ ador seeking a third con@@ secu@@ tive term , he said he sees that possibility `` with much optim@@ ism and joy , although at times it is pretty hard . ''
Cor@@ rea said that if he loses the elections in February 2013 , he will reti@@ re from public life .
personally , I 've never been interested in power , but in situations as un@@ just as those in Ecu@@ ador , socio = economic poverty can only be corrected by political power .
`` My political movement believed that it was me who ensured that prob@@ able victory , so we have to accept that responsibility '' he said .
if I won , it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life .
if I lose , likewise .
`` It 's a decision '' he confirmed .
Cor@@ rea also referred to Venezu@@ el@@ an President Hu@@ go Cha@@ vez 's new health treatment in Cuba .
I just spoke with Venezu@@ el@@ an Vice President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro and he tells me that Cha@@ vez went for treatment that was already planned , routine treatment , and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to Cuba .
`` This does not mean a health rela@@ pse for President Cha@@ vez '' he said .
in Lim@@ a today , the Ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an Head of State attended the Si@@ x@@ th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations ( UN@@ AS@@ UR ) , which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress , equality and security .
deaths caused by AIDS are nowadays due to late detection
Fabri@@ zio was 21 years old when they confirmed his test result : HIV positive .
`` It was like a bom@@ b dropped on me '' he says , rec@@ alling the time of the announcement , which the doctor was trying to make `` so@@ fter , '' apparently un@@ successfully .
the boy hi@@ d it from his family .
he decided to care for his illness alone and began to learn about it ; thanks to his efforts he has just celebrated his 4@@ 3rd birthday .
he is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Guad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara Civil Hospital ( Ch@@ g ) , where he arrived in 1994 after several batt@@ les with his health .
Fabri@@ zio has lived with the human imm@@ un@@ o@@ defici@@ ency virus ( HIV ) for 22 years , hard to imagine in the early ' 9@@ 0s , when there were many questions , few treatment options and a great deal of sti@@ g@@ ma .
then , even the director of an IM@@ SS [ Mexi@@ can Social Security Institute ] clin@@ ic refused to discharge him `` because he had a cut . ''
at that time , having A@@ ids was syn@@ onymous with death .
now it is possible to survive the syn@@ dro@@ me and do so with quality of life .
however , many people are still un@@ aware of their illness , and only seek help when the virus has already caused ha@@ vo@@ c , `` exhau@@ sted '' their imm@@ une systems and they are suffering from opport@@ un@@ istic infec@@ tions .
31 years after of the on@@ set of AIDS around the world , at least since the first reported cases , `` the great achievement at this time is that the life expec@@ tan@@ cy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expec@@ tan@@ cy of the general population is exactly equal '' stated the head of the Ch@@ g HIV Unit , J@@ aim@@ e An@@ dra@@ de Vil@@ lan@@ u@@ eva , saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific jour@@ nal .
infec@@ tious disease specialist and expert in HIV / AIDS , An@@ dra@@ de Vil@@ lan@@ u@@ eva said that since 2008 scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence , but that life expec@@ tan@@ cy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the imm@@ une system that patients present when they are diagno@@ sed , with a higher life expec@@ tan@@ cy for non = drug users : up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD@@ 4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 CD@@ 4 count .
in simple terms , this means that anyone diagno@@ sed HIV positive at 25 years old , under these terms and `` as long as they keep it under control , can live with no problems to 75 '' said the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ e .
to gau@@ ge this progress , it should be remember@@ ed that the average life expec@@ tan@@ cy of Mex@@ ic@@ ans today is 76 years .
although mor@@ tality has dropped significantly in recent years and , in the case of Mexico , the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6,@@ 6@@ 78 in 2007 to 4,@@ 8@@ 62 in 2011 ( UN@@ AIDS annual report ) , it is also true that since the adv@@ ent of AIDS , 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died .
in J@@ ali@@ sc@@ o alone , only 25@@ 5 people died in 2011 , and there have been 18@@ 7 deaths up to May of this year ; however , we are assured that there has been universal access to anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs since 2005 .
- Wh@@ y are do still deaths occur ?
- I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment .
that 's how I view it , and that 's how it 's been at our hospital .
for at least the last 12 years we 've had no shortage of medicine , the problem is that patients arrive in an advanced state of illness because they are un@@ aware of their HIV status , that is to say , the later stages of the disease .
he gave a comp@@ elling statisti@@ c : `` N@@ ine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opport@@ un@@ istic infection , so what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mor@@ tality is to make earlier diagno@@ ses and , therefore , offer mass detection tests for everyone who needs them . ''
specialists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Pre@@ vention in J@@ ali@@ sc@@ o ( CO@@ ES@@ ID@@ A ) agree on this proposal , as do the patients themselves , such as Fabri@@ zio , who came to be tested at a private laboratory , motivated only because a friend had done so and , despite his young age , he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered Ka@@ pos@@ i sar@@ com@@ a , a can@@ cer@@ ous tum@@ our that is one of the common complic@@ ations .
everything changes when you know you have AIDS .
some people think they ' re going to die and do n't want to know anything .
`` If I 'm going to die , I 'd rather have a blow = out three times a week '' they say , but not in my case .
the change was for the better ; I eat well , I exercise , I take my drugs .
to date , his parents are only aware he had cancer .
I live as normal a life as anyone else .
`` I work , I take part in a lot of activities , I travel , I have an active but responsible sex life , I take care of myself and the other person '' said Fabri@@ zio , who agreed to share his intimate secre@@ ts with M@@ IL@@ EN@@ IO J@@ AL@@ IS@@ CO , to motiv@@ ate those people with his story who today , in the context of World AIDS Day , are afraid .
they should get tested if they are at ris@@ k@@ . because the sooner they know if they are HIV positive , the better , and if they have already been diagno@@ sed , they must learn to live like any other person , while being responsible .
this is his message , which sum@@ mar@@ ises the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012 .
con@@ d@@ oms behind the counter .
the gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens are huge , said Ric@@ ardo Sal@@ az@@ ar , a journalist from Guad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara who has taken up the HIV cause .
and the greatest cure is prevention .
in places dedicated to this task `` the distribution of con@@ d@@ oms has actually increased ; previously , they used to give us one or two , now they give us pack@@ ets of a hundred , and that 's fine , but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access con@@ d@@ oms '' he said .
among the most vulnerable to new infec@@ tions are teen@@ agers .
`` Wh@@ y do you want them ? '' is a common question , asked with sar@@ cas@@ m and judged according to the values of social workers , coun@@ s@@ ell@@ ors , pharm@@ acy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to ex@@ pose teen@@ agers to sex , said the speaker .
it was decided to change such in@@ efficient allocation , and that con@@ d@@ oms should not only be placed behind counters , but that pack@@ ets of one hundred should be found in public toilet disp@@ en@@ sers in places frequ@@ ented by young people .
this is not promoting promis@@ cu@@ ity .
it is not about paying for their be@@ ers or mo@@ tel fees , as Govern@@ or Em@@ ili@@ o Gonz@@ al@@ ez said , when asked if there would be distribution of con@@ d@@ oms during his administration .
`` And it 's not about sexu@@ ality , but it is best to provide con@@ d@@ oms to those already practi@@ sing sexual activity '' he said .
J@@ ali@@ sc@@ o key points
there are 13@@ ,@@ 4@@ 35 cum@@ ul@@ ative cases ( 12@@ ,@@ 15@@ 8 AIDS and 1,@@ 3@@ 17 HIV ) .
the state is 4th in the nation in new and cum@@ ul@@ ative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV .
92 % of new infec@@ tions are through sex , 6 % via the blo@@ od@@ stream and 2 % per@@ in@@ at@@ al .
an estimated 50@@ ,000 people may be living with HIV , as for each registered case there are around 4 = 5 people who do not know they are positive .
ratified by a United States court of appeal , a jud@@ gement which igno@@ res the restructuring of the Vit@@ ro Group 's debt achieved via a bank@@ ru@@ pt@@ cy in Mexico , the scenario is an om@@ in@@ ous precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country that has solven@@ cy problems .
it seems , then , that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit Mexi@@ can law are not valid in the land of stars and stri@@ pes , contrary to international conventions .
in practical terms , the endor@@ sement of the jud@@ gement delivered on 15 June by Ju@@ dge Har@@ lin H@@ ale of the Bank@@ ru@@ pt@@ cy Court of the Northern District of Texas , leaves Mexi@@ can firms defen@@ cel@@ ess against possible sei@@ z@@ ure of their property outside of Mexico .
however , the decision opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Su@@ preme Court of the United States , claim@@ ing three in@@ consisten@@ cies .
from the start , while the trial judge notes that credi@@ tors should be governed by the United States Bank@@ ru@@ pt@@ cy Code , the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al for the Fif@@ th Cir@@ cu@@ it , based in New Or@@ le@@ ans , states that the main action is the in@@ solven@@ cy action handled in Mexico .
the first point would involve ignor@@ ing international procedural cooperation in cases of in@@ solven@@ cy of companies with transnational profiles .
indeed , the UN Model Law for International Trade Law Uni@@ formity was created for this purpose , with the American Law Institute positioned as arbitr@@ ator .
secondly , the jud@@ gement establishes that without the inter@@ company vote , with the debts the Vit@@ ro subsidiaries had with their parent company recognised in the critical mass of the in@@ solven@@ cy , the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved .
however , Mexi@@ can law recognises the possibility .
in fact , the Vit@@ ro case was not the first one in which the scheme was accepted .
there are half a do@@ zen examples , including Agre@@ me@@ x and Comm@@ er@@ cial Mex@@ ic@@ ana , whose inter@@ company debts were endorsed by the Federal Bank@@ ru@@ pt@@ cy Institute .
what is also certain is that , not including the votes of subsidiaries , the Vit@@ ro credi@@ tors who fought against it in the US courts , namely `` vul@@ ture '' funds such as Au@@ reli@@ os Capital , Au@@ reli@@ os Conver@@ gence , El@@ li@@ ot International and Li@@ ver@@ pool Limited , did not achieve a majority .
the vote was apparently 45 percent ver@@ sus 37 .
this data is om@@ it@@ ted by the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al .
from another perspective , the latter bl@@ ames Vit@@ ro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 , while trying to avoid the severe economic crisis faced by the United States , turning its back on the country .
for now , the Gonz@@ al@@ ez S@@ ada family firm has lo@@ dged a motion for re@@ consideration before the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al for the vote to reach the plenary of the court , that is , the five judges , given that only three voted previously .
should this fail , an appeal for review by a higher court , in this case the US Su@@ preme Court , will be filed .
the real problem is that the court b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ed a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the capacity of am@@ ic@@ us cur@@ i@@ ae ( `` friend of the Court '' ) , which details the procedure followed by Vit@@ ro under the framework of the Comm@@ er@@ cial In@@ solven@@ cy Law , no@@ ting that the latter dischar@@ ged itself with adher@@ ence to the agreements signed by the two countries to link it with Chap@@ ter 15 of the Bank@@ ru@@ pt@@ cy Act of the United States .
moreover , it should be noted that the country yiel@@ ded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade , that is the rules set for cross = border in@@ solven@@ cy cases , ensuring fair@@ ness for deb@@ tors and credi@@ tors .
double wh@@ am@@ my : vit@@ ro hit and country hit .

with the complaints put on the table by the unions of Mex@@ ic@@ ana Airlines against the former owner of the company , Gast@@ ón Az@@ c@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga An@@ dra@@ de , who is accused of mis@@ management , dor@@ man@@ t for several months , the Air@@ line Pi@@ lots Union Association already found the bott@@ len@@ eck .
the proceedings headed by Carlos Di@@ az Cha@@ vez Mor@@ ine@@ au has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Secur@@ ities Commission , which is accused of ob@@ struc@@ ting justice .
the claim is that the supervisory authority has consistently refused to provide reports to the Att@@ or@@ ney General 's Office on a transaction carried out by the emplo@@ yer to remove 19@@ 8 million p@@ es@@ os from trust F / 5@@ 89 of B@@ anc@@ o I@@ X@@ e , on behalf of Mex@@ ic@@ ana de Avi@@ ación .

oppos@@ ing Dra@@ gon M@@ art
a group of local and foreign environ@@ ment@@ alists , ac@@ adem@@ ics , business@@ men and members of the public gathered at the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean to approve the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dra@@ gon M@@ art in Can@@ cu@@ n .
as you know , we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean , selling Chinese products , with a residential area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies .
previously , Can@@ ac@@ in@@ tra had managed to unite the govern@@ ors of the sou@@ theast of Mexico to oppose the monum@@ ental building that destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all threats to industry .
the death of AC@@ TA
the Government ignored an order of the Sen@@ ate to explain under what terms and conditions the Mexi@@ can Ambass@@ ador in Japan signed the Anti = Co@@ unter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing Trade Agreement , known by its ac@@ ron@@ ym AC@@ TA , according to the Mexi@@ can Institute of Industrial Property , and the matter has already been archi@@ ved .
as you know , the action was taken even though the Sen@@ ate had ruled out the possibility , de@@ em@@ ing it an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks .

H@@ ec@@ tor `` He@@ tin '' Re@@ yes : `` Bas@@ ketball has been my life ''
bas@@ ketball glo@@ betro@@ tter H@@ ec@@ tor `` He@@ tin '' Re@@ yes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and , thanks to it , trav@@ elled the world .
few people in Puerto R@@ ico have a mental rec@@ ol@@ le@@ ction of local bas@@ ketball history as broad as that of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor `` He@@ tin '' Re@@ yes .
Re@@ yes was immer@@ sed in the sport for over 60 years before being con@@ fined to a whe@@ el@@ chair in 2008 following a stro@@ ke ; he was a minor le@@ ague player , National Superior Bas@@ ketball player , B@@ S@@ N representative and manager with the Bay@@ am@@ ón V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os or President of the Bas@@ ketball Federation .
`` I wor@@ e lots of h@@ ats in bas@@ ketball throughout my life , including several at the same time , like when I was president of the B@@ S@@ N , general manager and feder@@ ative president of the National Team during the ' 9@@ 0s , '' rec@@ alled Re@@ yes during Pri@@ mer@@ a Hor@@ a 's visit to his home in Bay@@ am@@ ón , where he lives with Isa@@ bel , his lo@@ yal wife for over 50 years .
`` Bas@@ ketball has been my life . ''
Re@@ yes is not exag@@ ger@@ ating when he makes that statement .
the walls of his house are almost totally decorated with pictures and mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a den@@ oting his long career , which goes to prove it .
Bay@@ am@@ ón at heart
of them all , the ones he treas@@ ures with the most emo@@ tion are the ones that remind him of his time spent with the V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os , from the mid = 50@@ s as a player until 1982 , when he completed 15 years serving as co = agent or agent of the fran@@ chise .
" those were my best years , the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os ' eight champ@@ ion@@ ships , since 1967 , either as agent , co = agent or manager .
there were many good years , including the five con@@ secu@@ tive champ@@ ion@@ ships from 1971 to 1975 .
and then I said good@@ by@@ e with one in 1981 , Jer@@ ome Min@@ cy 's de@@ but year in the B@@ S@@ N .
then `` Cu@@ co '' Or@@ tiz took over - he was a great manager " said Re@@ yes .
I remember that Gen@@ e Bar@@ to@@ w , who had directed here and was at the University of Al@@ ab@@ ama ( Birmingham ) , said to me ' I 've got a very strong player for you , 6 ' 7 " t@@ all .
do you want him ? '
and that was the beginning of Min@@ cy , one of the best players Puerto R@@ ico ever had .
Bar@@ to@@ w then recommended the Shar@@ p@@ sho@@ oter G@@ aus@@ se Ra@@ y@@ mond , who established re@@ sidency here and was one of our best sho@@ o@@ ters .
I remember him saying that if Min@@ cy had given Bay@@ am@@ on one champ@@ ionship , G@@ aus@@ se would help get another .
the V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os ' champ@@ ionship with G@@ aus@@ se was enjoyed , but from a distance , because in 1988 he was already becoming a feder@@ ative big@@ shot .
for that time , he preferred to enjoy his own and Min@@ cy 's accompli@@ sh@@ ments in the national team .
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the 1989 P@@ re = Olymp@@ ics in Mexico .
then came the 1990 World Cup , where we came fourth and it should have been bron@@ ze , but for the Canadian refer@@ ee who made us repeat the final play for the second time , said Re@@ yes .
is the 1990 World National Team the best you 've ever seen ?
it 's one of the best , as good as the one that beat the Dre@@ am Team in the 2004 Olymp@@ ics .
however , my favourite was the one in the 1991 P@@ an American Games in Cuba , when we won gold and gave the US team a be@@ ating , which was quite similar to the time we won bron@@ ze at the World Cup .
that team not only again included Min@@ cy , G@@ aus@@ se , Ram@@ on Ri@@ vas , F@@ ico L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z and ' P@@ icul@@ ín ' ( Or@@ tiz ) , but also the young ( J@@ avi@@ er ) ' To@@ ñ@@ ito ' Col@@ ón and James Car@@ ter , the Le@@ on bro@@ thers ( Francisco and Ed@@ gar ) and Mario ' Qui@@ jo@@ te ' Mor@@ ales , who was kept out of the 90 team by a kne@@ e injury .
a team that maybe was not the best in terms of members , but which gave us a gold me@@ dal and was a great joy to work with , was the 1995 P@@ re = Olympic team in Neu@@ qu@@ en , Argentina .
with role players such as ' Can@@ ito ' Nie@@ ves , P@@ ab@@ lo Alic@@ ea and the young Rol@@ ando H@@ our@@ ru@@ it@@ iner replacing the players suspended after the sh@@ amb@@ les of the Mar del Plat@@ a P@@ an = American Games , we won gold against all the odds .
who was the best Puerto Ri@@ can player ?
without any doubt , P@@ icul@@ ín Or@@ tiz .
his numbers at international tournament level are a@@ wes@@ ome .
nobody in Puerto R@@ ico has dominated at that level like P@@ icul@@ ín did .
not to mention his career in the various le@@ ag@@ ues he played in .
who was the best Puerto Ri@@ can manager ?
that 's a difficult one .
we had a very good team , including Ju@@ lio Tor@@ o , Fl@@ or Mel@@ ende@@ z , Carlos Mor@@ ales , Ra@@ y@@ mond Dal@@ ma@@ u , Ar@@ man@@ di@@ to Tor@@ res .
of the young@@ sters , I really like the work of Le@@ o Ari@@ ll .
what do you consider your greatest achievement in the feder@@ ation ?
having been part of the National Team 's most gl@@ orious era between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 9@@ 0s the B@@ S@@ N had up to 17 teams in a season .
what was there left for you to do ?
there were things I 'd have liked to implement , such as region@@ alising the minor le@@ ag@@ ues .
for example , the boys of P@@ once only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national pla@@ yo@@ ffs .
right now the kids are riding and playing too much , un@@ necessarily .
at least I see the fruit of compulsory certi@@ fications and a course for leaders , table officials and refer@@ ees .
that ple@@ ases me .
what are you doing now ?
the most I do is listen to music , watch music videos from my era on YouTube , enjoy my grand@@ children and occasionally go to bas@@ ketball games .
and of course , enjoy the company of my wife , Eli@@ za@@ beth , who has always been with me .
actor Lar@@ ry H@@ ag@@ man dies
Lar@@ ry H@@ ag@@ man , born on 21 September 19@@ 31 in Fort Wor@@ th ( Texas ) , became world famous for his role as John Ro@@ ss E@@ wing , better known as `` J@@ R , '' in the television series `` D@@ all@@ as , '' in which he played a ru@@ th@@ less , mali@@ cious and manipul@@ ative business@@ man .
Lar@@ ry H@@ ag@@ man , whose role as oil ty@@ co@@ on pre@@ dat@@ or J@@ R E@@ wing in the television series `` D@@ all@@ as '' became a symbol of gre@@ ed in the 1980s , has died .
he was 81 .
H@@ ag@@ man , who returned this year as J@@ R in a new season of `` D@@ all@@ as , '' died on Friday afternoon of cancer complic@@ ations , according to a family statement provided to the Associ@@ ated Press by the War@@ ner Bro@@ s. , producer of `` D@@ all@@ as . ''
`` Lar@@ ry was back in his bel@@ o@@ ved hom@@ et@@ own of D@@ all@@ as , once again representing the i@@ con@@ ic role he most liked '' the family said .
Lar@@ ry 's family and closest friends were with him in D@@ all@@ as for the Th@@ an@@ ks@@ giving Day holiday .
Lin@@ da Gra@@ y , who played his wife in the original series and the sequ@@ el , was with H@@ ag@@ man when he died in a hospital in D@@ all@@ as , said her public@@ ist , J@@ eff@@ rey Lan@@ e .
he brought joy to all who knew him .
he was creative , generous , fun@@ ny , lo@@ ving and tal@@ ented , and I will miss him de@@ arly .
`` He was an original guy and lived life to the full '' said Gra@@ y in a statement .
H@@ ag@@ man was diagno@@ sed with cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis of the li@@ ver in 1992 and admitted that he had dr@@ unk a lot over the years .
in 1995 a ma@@ lig@@ n@@ ant tum@@ our as found in his li@@ ver and he under@@ went a transp@@ l@@ ant .
years before `` D@@ all@@ as , '' H@@ ag@@ man became famous on television as a decent guy in the light com@@ edy `` I Dre@@ am of Je@@ ann@@ ie , '' aired on N@@ BC from 1965 to 1970 .
he played Captain Tony N@@ elson , an a@@ stron@@ aut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive gen@@ ie , played by Bar@@ bara Eden , and takes her home to live with him .
he also star@@ red in two sit@@ com@@ s that were not aired for long , `` The Good Life '' ( N@@ BC , 1971 = 72 ) and `` H@@ ere We Go A@@ gain '' ( AB@@ C , 1973 ) .
his film work included roles well received by critics in `` The Group , '' `` Harry and T@@ onto '' and `` Pri@@ m@@ ary Col@@ ors . ''
but it was his master@@ ful interpretation of deli@@ ght@@ fully dete@@ stable J@@ R that led to H@@ ag@@ man reaching his peak of star@@ dom .
the dra@@ ma series on C@@ BS about the E@@ wing cl@@ an and other characters in their or@@ bit aired from April 1978 to May 1991 .
the tag@@ line `` Wh@@ o shot J@@ R ? , '' designed to generate h@@ ype around an episode full of emotions in which H@@ ag@@ man 's character is nearly killed , generated international speculation and millions of ris@@ ky dollars wag@@ ered in gaming establishments .
it also helped give the series a record audience at the time .
when the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980 , an average of 41 million vie@@ wers tun@@ ed in and made `` D@@ all@@ as '' the second most wat@@ ched entertainment programme in history , after the final episode of `` M@@ AS@@ H '' in 1983 , which had 50 million vie@@ wers .
it was J@@ R 's sister = in = law Kris@@ tin ( played by Mary Cro@@ s@@ by ) who shot him .
J@@ r got her pregn@@ ant then threatened to say she was a pro@@ stitute unless she left town , but there were others who also had reasons to attack him .
H@@ ag@@ man portra@@ yed E@@ wing as a cor@@ rupt ins@@ ati@@ able man with a char@@ ism@@ atic smile : a dish@@ on@@ est entreprene@@ ur and che@@ ating husband who tried to have his alcoholi@@ c wife , Su@@ e El@@ len ( Lin@@ da Gra@@ y ) , sec@@ tioned .
`` I know what I want on J@@ R 's tom@@ bst@@ one '' H@@ ag@@ man said in 1988 .
it should read : `` H@@ ere lies the honest citizen J@@ R E@@ wing . ''
this is the only deal he lost .
Victoria Prin@@ cip@@ al , co = star of the original series , rec@@ alled H@@ ag@@ man on Friday as someone `` huge , on and off screen . ''
he is unforgettable and ir@@ replac@@ eable , for millions of fans around the world , and in the hearts of each one of us who was fortunate enough to know and love him .
ten ep@@ iso@@ des of the new edition of `` D@@ all@@ as '' were broadcast a few months ago with great success for T@@ NT .
he had already finished recording five ep@@ iso@@ des for the second series and a sixth was in process , the chain reported .
immediately after , there was no statement from War@@ ner or T@@ NT about how the series would handle the loss of H@@ ag@@ man .
H@@ ag@@ man , born in Fort Wor@@ th , Texas , was the son of act@@ ress and singer Mary Martin , who star@@ red in classi@@ cs such as `` South Pacific '' and `` Peter P@@ an . ''
Martin was still a teen@@ ager when she had him in 19@@ 31 during her marriage to lawyer Ben H@@ ag@@ man .
he tried his luck in the New York theatre scene in the early ' 50@@ s , and later served in the Air Force from 195@@ 2 to 1956 , in England .
while there , he met the young Swedish designer Ma@@ j A@@ x@@ els@@ son and married her .
the couple had two sons , Pre@@ ston and Hei@@ di , and lived for a long time in the Califor@@ ni@@ an city M@@ ali@@ b@@ u , home to many celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
in 2001 , he called his mem@@ o@@ irs `` H@@ ello Dar@@ lin ' : t@@ all ( and Ab@@ sol@@ utely Tru@@ e ) T@@ ales Ab@@ out My Life . ''
`` I did n't put anything in it that I believed would hur@@ t anyone or affect them in any way '' he told Associ@@ ated Press at the time .
after his li@@ ver transp@@ l@@ ant , he became an organ donation promo@@ ter and worked as a volunte@@ er at a hospital , helping fe@@ ar@@ ful patients .
`` I advise them , encourage them , meet with them when they come for their surgery , and afterwards '' he said in 1996 .
I try to offer some comfort , such as `` Do n't be afraid , it will be a little un@@ comfortable for a short time , but then you 'll be fine . ''
he was also an anti = smoking activ@@ ist and took part in several campaigns .
start of a course that explo@@ res the `` End of the World ''
each week , students explore apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic themes such as nuclear war , z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , viruses and ger@@ ms , and global warming .
this term , when Professor of religion , Stu@@ art char@@ m@@ é , decided to give a course on the end of the world , he knew he had a comp@@ elling ho@@ ok : the end of the `` long coun@@ t@@ down '' of the May@@ an calendar , 21 December , which had convinced many people that the end of the world was coming .
but char@@ m@@ é had no idea what awa@@ ited him over the next couple of months : the cat@@ ac@@ ly@@ s@@ mic hur@@ ri@@ cane Sand@@ y , a fiscal pre@@ cip@@ ice some called `` debt Ar@@ ma@@ ged@@ don '' and a growing conflict involving Israel , where end = of = the = world Christians the@@ ori@@ sts think the A@@ po@@ cal@@ yp@@ se will begin .
`` I did n't realise this was going to be the most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic term ever '' said char@@ m@@ é this week to students at R@@ ut@@ gers = Cam@@ den University ( New Jer@@ sey ) .
if you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting , this has been a really good period .
and remember that bad is good for those with an apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic ment@@ ality .
and he is not the only professor who offers courses on the `` end of the world '' this term , theore@@ tically the last in history .
at Temple , Associ@@ ate Professor Bar@@ ry v@@ ack@@ er is giving the course `` Media , Culture and the end of the world . ''
each week , students explore apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic themes such as nuclear war , z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , viruses and ger@@ ms , and global warming .
`` We looked at why these ideas pro@@ lifer@@ ate over time '' he said , and how they offer hypo@@ the@@ tical scenarios that guide human behaviour .
if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists , for example , a war could break out .
this month students analy@@ sed movies with an apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic theme and explo@@ red how they compare with real = life examples .
`` I 've tried to inform students about what is possible , prob@@ able , credible and impossible '' said v@@ ack@@ er .
at the main P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania State University camp@@ us , Latin American History Professor Mat@@ the@@ w Rest@@ all , and his colleague Am@@ ara Sol@@ ari , an Associ@@ ate Art History and Anth@@ rop@@ ology Professor , have te@@ amed up to give a course , called simply `` The end of the world . ''
`` We do n't add ' 2012 ' so we always have the option of running the course again , if the world does n't come to an end '' said Rest@@ all .
despite the `` im@@ pending do@@ om , '' students have to study , undertake projects and take final exam@@ s .
at Pen@@ n State , the final ex@@ am will be taken on the eve of the A@@ po@@ cal@@ yp@@ se , which leaves students no choice but to work `` until the very night the world is supposed to end '' said Rest@@ all .
the courses proved quite popular .
`` It was fully booked within two hours '' said Rest@@ all , on his course for students with high a@@ verages , which was filled with 35 students .
we received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the term , from people asking if there were any places .
students , meanwhile , say the course is one of the most interesting around .
`` I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves '' said Bri@@ d@@ gi@@ d Rob@@ inson , a 23 = year = old post = graduate Religion and Soci@@ ology student from H@@ add@@ on@@ field , New Jer@@ sey , at R@@ ut@@ gers = Cam@@ den .
and the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic , se@@ cular or religious ment@@ ality is just a matter con@@ sol@@ ation or a lack of it .
will We@@ k@@ esa , a 25 = year = old post = graduate Psych@@ ology and N@@ ur@@ sing student , said he had seen all the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic movies .
`` I 'd never heard of a class that could teach it '' he said .
I enjoy it .
but none of the students inter@@ viewed - much less any professor - said they believed in the end date of December 21st .
`` Our first project was about the May@@ an pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y and to a certain extent we dis@@ credited it '' said Ju@@ lie Z@@ eg@@ len , a 21 = year = old final year student at Temple , from West Ch@@ ester .
the May@@ ans never predic@@ ted the end of the world : it is just a key point in the calendar , said Rest@@ all .
but he said that Western culture suff@@ ers from apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic anxi@@ ety , which goes back several centuries , in which people react to changes around them by predic@@ ting the end of the world .
the Internet has caused a boom in these specul@@ ations .
`` In other places , people do n't think about it '' he said .
it 's mostly in the English = speaking world .
Joseph Dou@@ gh@@ er@@ ty , a Professor of religion at La S@@ alle University , who is giving courses in the Philipp@@ ines this year , responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any courses on the `` end of the world '' there .
`` The Philipp@@ ines are not taking part in the end of the world '' he wrote , suggest@@ ing an exception of a higher authority .
we have an indul@@ gence from the P@@ ope .
Rest@@ all noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last jud@@ gement , and said that if nothing happens on December 21st , `` people will immediately start thinking of the next date '' or philosop@@ h@@ ising that December 21st is the beginning of a seven = year period after which the world will end .
students and teachers are taking the date ligh@@ tly .
some said they plan to go to `` end of the world '' parties .
`` May@@ be I 'll call some friends so we can have a lau@@ gh together '' said Sam@@ ira Ford , 20 = year = old communications student .
